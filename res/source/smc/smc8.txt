{#Spiritual Unity in the Ministry of John and Other Readings and Addresses}
{1}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (1)
@1 John 5: 6 - 10; 2 John; @3 John 1 - 8, 12 - 14
S.McC. It is proposed that we should look at the subject of spiritual unity in the ministry of John. As the brethren would recall immediately at the mention of it, unity has a great place in his ministry. It is a very full and extensive subject in his ministry, entering into all his writings. It is proposed that we should look this morning first at unity in relation to the truth, which has such a prominent place in the passages that we have read. Then we may, if the Lord should help, go to the Revelation, and see unity in the ministry of John as it appears in the testimonial position in relation to reproach and suffering, and also, in relation to glory, in the administrative setting. Then we may go to the gospel of John, for the extensive side of the subject, to see how spiritual unity develops in relation to the servants and their service; and in relation to the flock and the family of God figuratively set out in John's ministry. Then we shall need to see how it enters into the great subject of the service of God, where under the hand of the minister of the sanctuary, as in @John 17, the great thoughts of unity and oneness are stressed. Then entering into it, and running alongside of it, we have the great truths of eternal life, and sonship, and the revelation of God in Christ, all having in mind the promotion of this thought of spiritual unity amongst us.
Now in proposing @1 John 5 to be read, one has in mind that we should consider first of all that this unity must have a moral basis. Any unity that does not have a moral basis amongst us will not last very long. The brethren will remember how, in the history
{2}
of Jehoshaphat, he joined himself to the wicked king Ahaziah in regard to the ships, and how God intervened to break them up; @2 Chronicles 20: 35 - 37. How much there has been around of amalgamation, and the promotion of a unity that does not have its basis in the water and the blood, and in relation to the Spirit. So it is thought that we should first consider the Spirit, and the water and the blood, whose witness agrees in one. If the witness agrees in one, as it is received, and as it affects the brethren, it must produce a corresponding subjective result with us, so that there is spiritual unity. Then, not only do we have a moral basis emphasised in the first epistle, but the truth comes on to our view in the second epistle as the great bond by which we are bound together. We want to see the importance of the truth, as entering into the way we are bound together in spiritual unity. The truth is a most important and effective bond; we cannot disregard it. We want to see its importance in the second epistle, where reference is made to the doctrine of the Christ, taking us back to what has come out in the teaching of Christ, and in His ministry, linked with the revelation of God in Him. Then we should see how love enters into the matter, too, as in verse 5 of the second epistle, "And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from the beginning, that we should love one another. And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments". And then, the witness to the love of Gaius before the assembly is very affecting, especially as we see the controlling and dominating place that the truth has in both these relations. But first of all, we have this matter of the water which stresses the moral side with us, and the essentiality of a purified state amongst us. We are to be free from what is of the world, and free from what is linked with the man of
{3}
sin and shame, so that the spiritual unity to which we refer can be promoted. That is what was in mind, counting on the Lord to help.
A.J.G. I am sure it will be profitable to us.
J.T.Jr. Would the thought of unity be in the Lord's service in the gospels and connected with the service of the apostles in the Acts, so that it is one thing that has come down to us?
S.McC. I thought so. I thought it was embodied in the expression "the doctrine of the Christ". What was set out in the Lord's service and in the service of the apostles, as you say, has come down to us; and we are to be affected by it. There is no new development, as it were; there is nothing to be added to that. We are coming into it in our time, on the line of recognising what is there and being controlled by it.
P.L. So that Christianity is all set forth in the Person of Christ. There has been nothing added, nor could there be, whatever unfoldings the Spirit has afforded.
S.McC. So that John stresses what is from the beginning. It is an important matter that we are to be affected and regulated by what is from the beginning; the fathers, that is those in a position of parental influence among the saints, being specially alluded to as knowing Him that is from the beginning. So that things are maintained in relation to that.
J.T.Jr. Would you think then that the ministry of John comes in especially in view of the disunity that is in Christendom?
S.McC. One has felt that very specially. We even get in John's gospel the prophetic announcement through Caiaphas as to the Lord's death, and John the evangelist in commenting on it by the Spirit refers to the important point that "he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", @John 11: 52. That is a
{4}
remarkable reference bearing on the prophecy preceding from the mouth of a man like Caiaphas, but it shows us abstractly what is in mind in John's ministry.
J.T.Jr. I thought too, that the disunity that is in Christendom may have its reflection amongst us.
S.McC. Therefore we are to be searched in relation to the matter, and one feels it brings up the need for emphasis on the water. That is, the death of Christ in its separative and purifying aspect, as that which would set us apart from all the divisive features and elements amongst us, and in us, that in the world make way for the man of sin.
A.P.C.L. The first reference to the water in verse 6 is "*he* that came by water and blood, Jesus the Christ". It is connected with the Person; it is not only an abstract matter in that sense, but "This is *he* that came". I was thinking of what has been said as to what is in the Person.
S.McC. And does not this become the great test in Christianity? John says earlier, "every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that power of the antichrist, of which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world". That is, all that is around us is affected by the influence of antichristian principles, that would bring in a rival to Christ, and bring in what is divisive in that sense.
J.B.S. What would the name "Jesus the Christ" be intended to convey to us?
S.McC. I think it is to call our attention to a different kind of humanity, a different kind of Man. In the gatherings, in the assemblings, we need to see the importance of a different kind of humanity. All around us in Christendom we see the kind of humanity that likes to have a vain show, what will make much of the flesh, and in the world we see the kind of humanity that will make everything of what
{5}
is material -- money, and power in a material and political way, but in the assembly we are to be affected by this different kind of humanity -- "Jesus the Christ".
A.J.G. The Man who is approved and anointed of God -- the Christ.
S.McC. Exactly. That is the kind of humanity that God can commit Himself to. And the water is to help us to judge unsparingly in our souls the features of the humanity and of the kind of man that He has expressed His displeasure in regard to in the death of Christ, typified in the water.
P.H.H. What exactly is pointed to in the thought of coming? "This is he that *came* by water and blood", Is it to concentrate our attention on these two things?
S.McC. I think it is. It is not a question of what is chronological, it is not a question exactly of a point of time, it is a question of the Lord coming into the sphere of the testimony, where full witness and testimony is to be rendered to this kind of humanity.
P.H.H. Therefore it includes the historical matter of His death, where the water and the blood became manifest. Would the death of Christ in that respect be one of the points in the testimony?
S.McC. It is. And we are to note in that sense, that in the gospel, the blood comes first, whereas in the epistle the water comes first. Well, that is not for nothing. In the gospels, things are presented to us objectively for faith to lay hold of, but when we come to John's epistle, the state of the saints is in mind, so that the water precedes the mention of the blood.
A.J.G. John lays particular stress on the witness. "He who saw it", he says, referring to the coming out of the blood and water, "bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that
{6}
ye also may believe", @John 19: 35. Does he not attach great importance to this matter of the blood and the water, in the gospel, and the water and the blood in the epistle?
S.McC. It is very interesting to see that, how along with the witness is stressed the moral value of the witness, the authenticity of it, "he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true". There is thus abundant authoritative witness to this matter of the blood and the water; and the water and the blood. This is very important, because in the general position, in the professing body, and coming nearer, amongst ourselves, there is sometimes great uncertainty and perhaps wonderment, as to what is really the truth; whereas John would emphasise that what he says is true. That is specially important in those that minister.
A.H. Has John in mind the maintenance of the saints in victory?
S.McC. I would say so, the beginning of the chapter emphasises that. How can victory be maintained amongst us, and how can spiritual unity be established, if this moral basis is not right in our souls? We must have a judgment as to the state from which there arises the difficulties, the unbelief, the deception, and all that is linked with that man. We are to have a right judgment of it, and, through the water aspect of the death of Christ, see the value of a new state.
G.R.C. Would it be justifiable to bring in Paul's doctrine to support what has been said? He says in Ephesians, "But ye have not thus learnt the Christ, if ye have heard him and been instructed in him according as the truth is in Jesus; namely your having put off according to the former conversation the old man ... and your having put on the new man, which according to God is created in truthful righteousness and holiness", @Ephesians 4: 20 - 24. I was
{7}
wondering whether "the doctrine of the Christ", as has been indicated, and our learning of Him involves His present position, and the truth in Him as set out where He is; and that involves the water, our having put off the old man.
S.McC. I think there is a definite link with Paul's ministry in that setting. We often refer to the locating points in John's ministry that link on with Paul's, and this is one that particularly links on with that section to which you refer, as to truthful righteousness and holiness. The water has to do with that state amongst the saints, where there is nothing opaque, where there is nothing clandestine, where there is uprightness and transparency, and where the truth has full place.
G.R.C. So that the truth as it is in Jesus involves our having put off the old man. Does not the water imply that, that we have done it by profession, and we are to do it in practice? Is that right?
S.McC. That is how I understand it.
J.T.Jr. So that baptism is the crux of the matter as to application, not just profession?
S.McC. Exactly. The death of Christ, in that separative way, sets us apart from the world, and the man that is in it, and the taking up of the practical teaching of it involves our arrival at this new state, where things are transparent, things are upright amongst us.
R.W. Is that seen in the eunuch, who after he had listened to the word said, "Behold water"? He was baptised and went on his way rejoicing.
S.McC. He got an impression as to the need of the water; and would to God that we all had a greater impression of the need of the water. Why is it that so many princes amongst us have fallen out by the way? I believe, speaking soberly and calculatingly, that it is because the water, and the state which the water produces, have been lacking.
{8}
That bears on us all now, for every one of us, in our hearts and our souls, should be greatly concerned, that the state which the water produces should not be lacking.
A.J.G. Would you say that the sense of the need of the water produces the sense of the need positively of the Spirit, as the power for the new life, and as the witness to us?
S.McC. So the water can only be rightly arrived at in its value, or be applied, in the power of the Spirit, in that sense. It is not a question of the human mind, or the resource of the flesh entering into it, because the water sets all that aside.
A.J.G. And the Spirit comes into prominence as *the* truth. "It is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth".
S.McC. It is very important to see the Spirit referred to in this way, because it links on with the truth as the bond of fellowship in the second and third epistles. The Lord is the truth objectively, at the right hand of God, but the Spirit is the truth subjectively here in the saints.
J.S.E. May there be some explanation for us now, as to how, since the Spirit has acquired a personal place among the brethren. He has had scope to bring emphasis into the ministry as to purification? One was wondering whether the word in Hebrews, "Sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water", would have any bearing upon what is in your mind?
S.McC. It has a very definite bearing. The recovery of the saints to the recognition of the Spirit, and what is due to Him, and the place that He has in the service of God, in an all-embracive way, is not only to affect us objectively, but it is to affect us subjectively and practically, in all associations of life. So that the Lord has been stressing, on the eve of translation, the importance that we should be
{9}
clean from every feature of the state that has been set aside in the death of Christ.
J.S.E. We have come into the gain of this better translation. According to the Authorised Version heaven and earth stood in contrast, reference being made to three bearing witness in heaven, and three on earth, but does the Spirit and the water, and the blood, all apply to us as here on the earth?
S.McC. It is important to see that because the whole point is our position in the testimony here. It is remarkable how the numeral three comes into it, because the numeral three has a great place in God's world. We have the three in creation, and we have the three in the tabernacle system, supremely we have the Three in the Trinity. And it is remarkable that we should have the three referred to in this way here, "and the three agree in one". There is no diversity in thought in the witness here. And there would be no diversity of thought, or action, in the result and the effect that it produces, in the state that is marked by what is effected by the death of Christ in this way.
C.M.M. Is the washing of the robes in @Revelation 22 connected with the water?
S.McC. I think so. It is not the blood so much, important as the blood is, and we do not want to miss it here, but what is stressed is the water. Especially is it important in persons being accorded to the right to the tree of life, as it says in @Revelation 22, that there should be clear testimony to the fact that the water, typically speaking, is employed by them in the washing of their robes.
E.E.H. Is there a link with what you have in mind in @John 3 in the Lord's own words, "Except any one be born of water and of the Spirit"?
S.McC. There is a link, only in @John 3 it is the basic side that is emphasised, what is there basically through the operation of God to begin with, in new
{10}
birth. When we come to the epistle where we have "begotten of God", we come to what is fuller, and what involves testimony presented, which by faith and by the Spirit, we lay hold of and apply.
J.McK. Is your thought that the full result should be seen in the saints in this holy agreement?
S.McC. That is what is in one's mind. The result of what we have here would be spiritual unity or oneness in the saints.
J.McK. You mean that the idea of witness involves something that can be identified, and the three agreeing in one, in this witness, would be in the saints as affected?
S.McC. Exactly. Why is it that diversity of opinion and of judgment comes up amongst us? It must be that the matter of the water has not the place that it should have, especially where evil may be involved.
A.H. In @Zechariah 13, after the prayers of chapter 12, you have the fountain opened in Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness. And what follows upon that is remarkable unity as to the exclusion of idols, and even those who minister wrongly. Does that bear on what you have in mind?
S.McC. It does. Zechariah is concerned about uncleanness, and we should be concerned about uncleanness wherever we are, in any part of the world; for in our time, the Lord is stressing practical conditions amongst the saints, subjective conditions entering into this matter of life, and spiritual unity, because the life is to work out in spiritual unity. It is not just an abstract idea of life, it is to work out in spiritual unity among the brethren as the features of the world are abominated and judged and set aside in our souls.
H.W. Is the same end in view in Paul's ministry, where he presses in all his assembly epistles, the truth of the cross?
{11}
S.McC. Yes, you can see what a place the water had with Paul. I am sure it raises the question with all of us, as to the place that the water has with us, not just in teaching, and what is set out; but the place that the water has in our souls, whether we are marked by a purified state in our souls. If we minister or serve without being marked by a purified state, pure motives and pure thinking, we are bound to impart that to those that we minister to and serve. It is bound to have a reaction in them, with a result that corresponds.
M.A.W. Would "the washing of water by the word" (@Ephesians 5: 2) be a similar thought?
S.McC. There is a link in it with what we have here; it all shows the importance of the death of Christ in the water aspect. What would you say. Mr. M.?
A.E.M. I think it is very important that we should understand this, particularly with those that minister. If the minister is not clear, the saints will not be clear.
S.McC. You feel that very much, and the word comes home, as we speak together, and seek to help one another in relation to this matter. It is an important matter that practical, subjective conditions, a right state, should be present in those that serve and minister amongst the saints.
C.J.H.D. It was in a place where it says there was a great deal of water, that the minister was able to say "He must increase, but I must decrease".
S.McC. You mean John the baptist in chapter 3 of the gospel. Just so. John's ministry came along the line of the water, and the Jews were puzzled by him, as the Jews always will be puzzled by the minister who brings the water in.
A.E.M. Before you minister you must be assured before God as to your own moral state, and the truth that you minister must be clear in your mind. You
{12}
would not minister in connection with what you do not know.
S.McC. That is very important, because it involves the result in the saints. We are to see, therefore, the care that is needed that the truth should not be taken on lightly, and should not be ministered lightly. It should first have reaction in the soul of the minister, in the presence of God, so that his motives are pure; there is no opaqueness with him. You know where he is and where he stands. You have no difficulty, there is no obliqueness in what he says, or what he means to say. This is very important, for it is one of the cunning devices of the enemy, that where he has been defeated in the open battlefield, as at Calvary in the death of Christ, he has resorted to means of deception; and where he was defeated in the spirit of the martyrs who would not yield, he has resorted to deception, so that as the church came under the power of the State in the time of Constantine, worldliness came in, the death of Christ, in water aspect, was set aside. So as we come right down to our own times, in those that minister, if the water has not got its place, we shall resort to human means to make up for spirituality, and to make up for a purified state of things in our souls.
C.H. Would the teaching of this therefore imply death to what the man is, and not only what he has done? I think so often we limit the death of Christ to what we have done, whereas it has the utmost importance in its application to what the man is.
S.McC. That is very important, it involves the end of the man. That is, the water flowed from a dead Christ. The water did not flow from the Lord before He died, it flowed out of the side of a dead Christ, meaning that man was ended, as the Lord entered into death. He entered death vicariously in order that that condition which in us, sin attached to, might be terminated.
{13}
W.C. Would Peter, as a minister, have all this in mind, in regard of the sheet? We get there "what God has cleansed", as though it is a complete thing before God. There is the complete sweeping away of man after the flesh, but having in mind the securing of men after the order of Christ. Then it is "Rise up, Peter, slay and eat". I was thinking of what Peter said in his epistle as to souls being saved through water at the time of the flood. Would not Peter have that in mind as preceding the vision of the sheet? God was teaching him in that way what the flood meant in view of bringing in His own thoughts in another order of man.
S.McC. You mean the way that the whole scene was cleansed and purified by that action of God.
W.C. Peter would start with that in his ministry, having in mind to secure men, completely free from the world that had been judged by God so fully, by the sweeping away of the whole scene.
S.McC. Yes. And it is important that we should see the place that the blood has, too, because we must not forget the blood. The blood brings in the judicial side, and the thought of expiation and has to do with acts of sin, which have not been met lightly, for the meeting of the guilt linked with them involved this judicial way which the blood draws to our attention. Any person that has got a light judgment of sin has never, in his soul before God, come to what the blood really means.
G.R.C. So that the blood greatly affects our hearts. Mr. Taylor said, many years ago, that this scripture "not by water only" is an implied reference to the flood, which was water only. God ended the world by water only, and the end of all flesh came before Him, but now it is by water and blood, and the blood retains the person.
S.McC. That is very important. Divine love did not come in in relation to the flood, divine love came
{14}
in in relation to the death of Christ; see @1 John 3: 16; so that we do not have the water only, we have the water and the blood. The blood becomes the great basis on which redemption is effected, the way into the presence of God is thus opened up, and the way by which the heart of God is open to us.
P.H.H. The blood being mentioned, for instance, in the Lord's supper, is calculated to affect our hearts. We might not think so much about the water, and the death of Christ, but with the blood it is unmistakable, and serves to affect our hearts all the time, every time it is mentioned.
S.McC. It does. So that Hebrews, which is dealing with the approach, greatly magnifies the blood before our souls. It is through that holy instrumentality that we draw near: "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies, by the blood of Jesus", @Hebrews 10: 19.
G.R.C. Before we leave the first epistle, could you say another word as to the Spirit, and the stress upon the Spirit in the end of verse 6? It says, "it is the Spirit that bears witness", that is the first thing brought in as to witness, and then, when it gives the three, it puts the Spirit first.
S.McC. I think it is important to see the place that the Spirit has in this matter. The water and the blood have in mind the producing of a state in the saints, in a purified way, and the witness of the Spirit comes in actively in relation to that state. We thus get all the gain of the witness, so that as we come down the chapter, the witness is said to be in ourselves. We do not need, as it were, to go outside of ourselves to get confirmation in that sense, as to where we are in relation to God; we have the witness in ourselves, and the witness in ourselves involves the Spirit. It is because He is the truth, not in one part, not in one division, but the truth in its entirety. The witness has to do with that.
{15}
G.R.C. Would you just say a further word as to the meaning of that expression "The Spirit is the truth"?
S.McC. I think it involves the Spirit as the truth here in the saints. The Lord is the truth at the right hand of God. He said when here, "I am the way, the truth, and the life". But the Spirit is the truth now down here, in the saints. It is a great help to see that we are in the presence of the truth in its entirety, in a divine Person, amongst the saints.
W.D. What bearing has the fact that when the Lord speaks of the coming of the Comforter He speaks of Him as *the Spirit of truth*?
S.McC. I think it helps us to see in regard of what we have here, that safety marks this position, as we recognise the Spirit, in that He is the truth -- not in one part of it, or in two parts of it, but the whole truth. And we are in the presence of it in the witness. It says, "it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth". Now the enemy would have us, at times, get occupied with one side of the truth, and perhaps be developed in relation to one side of the truth, whereas the point here is, the truth in its entirety.
C.H. Is that implied in verse 2 of the second letter?
S.McC. There is a remarkable link in verse 2 of the second letter with the Spirit of God, because almost the same expression is used as to the Spirit in @John 14 as is used of the truth here. The Lord says in @John 14, "I will beg the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see him nor know him; but ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", verses 16, 17. There is a remarkable link with the truth in that way, for it says here "for the truth's sake which abides in us and shall be with us
{16}
to eternity". I think this would greatly help us, because sometimes in conversation, and in what may be said publicly, the truth seems to be regarded as something that perhaps does not matter much how you speak about it, and a kind of an optional and casual way is employed in regard to it. Whereas, the word here is "the Spirit is the truth". The truth is a great bond of fellowship between the saints.
C.H. Certain cardinal truths connected with the Spirit have been said, in recent years, to be just Christian liberties, and not to be obligatory; but these epistles show that the truth is obligatory, because it involves the presence of a divine Person here.
S.McC. Therefore the truth has a binding influence amongst the saints. Persons sometimes say, 'Oh, if we only had a presentation of Christ objectively, it would unite us all together'. Well, of course it would -- that is another side of the truth; but then, the truth, if it has full authority and power in our souls, also has a binding influence among the saints.
A.P.C.L. Would it be going too far to think of the Spirit personally as being the truth, not only as seen subjectively in the saints, but what there is in Himself as a divine Person?
S.McC. I would like to hear more what is in your mind in that regard.
A.P.C.L. I was only thinking of the possibility of a time when there was little, perhaps, subjectively in the saints, whereas the matter is there in His Person, do you think, or is that going too far?
S.McC. Do you mean the reference "the Spirit is the truth"?
A.P.C.L. Yes, as to whether one glory of His own Person would be that, that He is the truth. I was only thinking it would emphasise more what you are saying as to the truth being the bond; because
{17}
it really is what lies in the divine Person who is here. I would like to get clear as to that.
S.McC. My own impression of it is that it has a subjective bearing, the Spirit being here in the saints because, whatever may have come into the dispensation in the introduction of failure and ruin and breakdown, there has always been, in the martyrs, and in faithful ones here and there, a certain subjective answer in which the truth has been there, although it is not in a full way in which we have it in the recovery, and in the revival; and as it was in the pristine state of the assembly. But the Spirit is not incarnate, and when the ruin and breakdown came in. He still was here, and the unity of the Spirit still was here. I think it bears on all that.
J.T.Jr. He came into the assembly, and He is still here.
S.McC. That is it. When the ruin and the breakdown came in, and the Dark Ages came in, the Spirit did not retire into heaven. He remained here, because the assembly in that sense, *in principle*, goes through intact. It is affecting to think of the Spirit being here all through the Dark Ages.
A.P.C.L. That is what I was thinking, that if the matter lies with the Spirit, what a resource there is for us.
S.McC. Just so.
J.T.Jr. To know that He is here in the way that He was when He came.
S.McC. He has not changed a bit. And it is not what He is in Deity. "The Spirit is the truth" is not a reference to what He is in Deity, but what He is here in the assembly.
J.S.E. Did not that same principle apply when Christ was here amongst His own? Could we not rightly say that He was amongst them in a condition that they could take account of; and that in that condition He says "I am the way, and the truth,
{18}
and the life. No one comes to the Father unless by me". Does He not, as having gone to heaven, present Himself now, according to the scripture referred to in Ephesians, as the One in whom the truth is? But is not the Spirit here taking the place that Christ had here, as He Himself said, "another Comforter", and is not John, in this epistle, enlarging on that in view of this spiritual unity that we are concerned about?
S.McC. I think so. Now that the Lord has gone to the right hand of God, the truth in all its fulness is seen in Him objectively there, but it is now in this passage linked with the Spirit here in the assembly, that *He* is the truth. It helps to see if we except the scripture in Jeremiah (which has a characteristic, or relative reference), that God is said to be true but never said to be "the truth". But the Persons that are said to be the truth are the Persons in the mediatorial position. The Mediator, the Lord Jesus Christ on high, and what He was down here, and then the Spirit here in the assembly.
P.L. Is it because the truth is not presented absolutely, but it is presented relatively as coming within our range in divine Persons in the economy?
S.McC. Truth involves comparison and stands over against error in that sense being the expression of what God is, but viewed in His essential existence, God does not express Himself. He is what He is; He cannot be compared with anything, as J.N.D. said. Scripture says, "God is love", which is an absolute reference.
R.W. The presence of the Spirit as the truth is seen in the meeting of evil in @Acts 5.
S.McC. Yes. And what is to be noted in this section is that the truth is personified. The truth will make way for itself, like the ark in the land of the Philistines. The power of God is linked with it, bringing down things, the truth does that.
{19}
J.S.E. Do we need to understand, that both in the case of Jesus, and in the case of the Spirit, they are Each, in turn, said to be the truth, *but*, as in a circle of holy affinity with their feelings? Does not this matter of the water, if applied, bring us more into correspondence with what is proper to that circle?
S.McC. That is the whole point in the water, that we should be delivered from the world, and the system of things in it, and what is linked with man, and his state, and be linked up with a system of things that is marked by what is purified, and is in affinity with the Spirit of God. The state is a result of the work of Christ and the Spirit being here in this way.
J.S.E. Does that make the allusion to "yourselves" in the second epistle more understandable by us? Is "yourselves" a term which denotes the circle of affinity with the Spirit here as the truth?
S.McC. Just so.
A.J.G. So that the Spirit as the truth requires, for its expression, saints in moral accord with Himself?
S.McC. I think it is very important to see that. We do not thus talk over these matters as just platitudes and things that entertain our minds, but they have in view a corresponding state being produced in us, a state that is marked by uprightness, honesty and transparency, that is the fruit of the water aspect of the death of Christ applied in the power of the Spirit.
R.G.B. Do the distinctive references to walking bear on that, particularly the walking in the truth, and walking according to His commandments?
S.McC. That is very important, because we might say, Well, John is getting very detailed and very extreme; he says that if a man goes forward, and abides not in the doctrine of Christ and perhaps has got a new development in mind, and is opening up what might be called some fresh feature of the truth,
{20}
that is in advance of Christianity, the sisters should hear this, and pay attention to it. John says to the elect lady, "If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine", notice the word 'doctrine', the teaching, "do not receive him into the house, and greet him not; for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works". We might say, Well, could we not say 'Good day' to him, or 'Good afternoon'? 'No', John says if you do that, you partake in his wicked works. Now this is the holy Scriptures, this is what the scripture says, and the Spirit of God inspires the record.
J.G.M. How does the Lord's word in @John 17 bear upon this matter, when He says, "Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth"?
S.McC. Well, there is a link with it in that the truth becomes the instrument or agency, in the power of the Spirit, by which we become set apart from this world. The truth there is that Christ is in glory, the Object of the affections of His people. And if the Object of our affections is there, how could we get absorbed with things here? How could we get enmeshed in associations here? It has got a delivering effect.
A.J.G. In this second epistle of John, and in the third, we get the expression "Walking in truth", and then, "walking in *the* truth". Do you draw any distinction between those two?
S.McC. I think there is; could you say something to help us on it, as to what is in your mind?
A.J.G. I was just seeking to get it clarified. We have "walking in truth" in verse 4 of the second epistle, and "thou walkest in truth" in verse 3 of the third, and then "I hear of my children walking in *the* truth" in verse 4 of the third.
S.McC. Is not the one a question of what is characteristic, and affects us subjectively and in practice, and the other -- walking in *the* truth -- involves
{21}
what governs and controls our outlook, our thoughts? You get, for instance, in verse 1, "The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth", It is the character of the love. Now this is very important, because we should have no natural likings for one another, there should not be those that we like better than others, we are not to be respecters of persons. Then if we love in the truth, it is like another link with Paul's ministry in Colossians, "love in the Spirit"; that is, we are not governed by one another according to what we are naturally.
H.W. Is there any link, or any connection, between the thought of *the* truth, and "our faith", or "the faith once delivered to the saints", that Jude speaks of?
S.McC. I think there is a link in that sense. We walk in the truth, and the truth has come out. I mean, we do not expect exactly that there will be fresh revelations of the truth in these meetings, in the sense in which we are now speaking of it. The truth has all been laid out, what we are seeking to get at is what has been laid out, and what the Lord is seeking to help us to get into. The water is necessary for that, and the Spirit is necessary for that.
H.W. Would that be encompassed, by the thought of "our faith", which gets victory over the world?
S.McC. Well, there you have a link.
G.C.H. I understand the expression "for the Spirit is the truth" is a reciprocal statement.
S.McC. Yes, it can be reversed, so that the truth is the Spirit. That is very important, in connection with the recognition of it, for "the Spirit bears witness", implies the assembly. He is not exactly bearing witness to the angels, it is not that He is in heaven at this point, bearing witness, and this is the value of the New Translation, but it is the Spirit that bears witness here for the Spirit *is* the truth, or the truth is the Spirit.
{22}
C.H. In your reference a little earlier, to verses 9 and 10 in the second letter, you spoke about the importance of not receiving those who abide not in the doctrine; if the truth and the teaching connected with the truth becomes the bond of fellowship, are we to understand that it will increasingly become the test of fellowship?
S.McC. It will. Because it is the truth that abides in us and shall be with us to eternity. It is not special friendships, special leanings, special likes and dislikes; it is the *truth* that abides in us and shall be with us to eternity. And the truth will become increasingly the bond. But we should see in that way how it is bound up with the two holy Persons in the mediatorial position, the Lord Jesus at the right hand of God, and the Spirit here in the assembly. So that we should not speak carelessly, or lightly in regard to the truth, as if something was being made an issue that does not mean much. We may be assaulting, or attacking, a divine Person.
C.M.M. Would you say a word about "Jesus Christ coming in flesh"? In the first epistle it says "Come in flesh". I was wondering as to the word 'coming'. Could it be connected with @Hebrews 10, "Wherefore coming in to the world he says ..."?
S.McC. "For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming ..." It is not the chronological side, but I understand the reference to the "coming" to imply that it is the form and character seen in the action of this Person. No other Person could do this. I mean, no other man could do this; it could only be said of One who was a divine Person. In the first epistle "Jesus Christ come in flesh" is a statement of actual fact that He came into that condition of humanity.
H.B. Will you say a word as to "In him was life and the life was the light of men"? Does that bear
{23}
upon what you are saying? If we do not walk in the light, we are not practising the truth; "He that practises the truth comes to the light", @John 3: 21.
S.McC. Well, it is very important, because it bears on the state that the water would produce. Things are out in the open, transparent, no opaqueness. God is in the light, why should we not be in the light? Why should I have anything that I do not want the brethren to know? Why should everything not be laid open? Why should there be any dark parts, dark spots that I do not want to disclose? If God is in the light, we are to walk in the light as He is in the light, and have fellowship with one another. And the water would help us as to that.
J.P.H. Would Demetrius be one who was walking in the light?
S.McC. I think he was. It says of him, that he "has witness borne to him by *all*, and by the truth itself". You would never have any difficulty about Demetrius. Wherever he went among the brethren, he had "witness borne to him by all". You might say universally. Demetrius would be known, and then it says "and by the truth itself". What a fine reference to any person!
J.P.H. Was he an exemplar in that way of all the truth that he had been taught?
S.McC. I think he was. The Lord said "He that practises the truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested, that they have been wrought in God", @John 3: 21. Demetrius was that. If we are not doing the truth, we will be afraid of the light; none of us wants to be afraid of the light, and it is important that every one of us should be in the light as God is in the light.
P.H.H. Do you think that is illustrated in some of the men around David, like Joab, who passed muster in a public way, yet when the test came, it
{24}
showed that they were dark, and not walking in the truth? So it led to something sectional.
S.McC. It is very important to see that, because one thing that marks the antichristian world and antichristian principles is deception. That is, in the system around us, we have the mysterious habiliments and dress; it is all deceiving, and when the enemy has been defeated in the open battlefield, he resorts to deception. It may be even through innuendos, oblique hints, or covert allusive statements, that inject virus into the blood-stream, and bring about a state of innocuousness amongst the saints, so that the truth loses its sting and power in their conscience.
P.H.H. Here the deception you speak of is connected with antichrist, it says, "This is the deceiver and the antichrist". That shows the origin of it.
S.McC. That is it. And John, in his writings, in the epistles, would remind us that there are many antichrists, and I have to see to that in my heart. Every one of us has to see to this feature of what is antichristian, because if any allowance is made for it, we shall get what we have in the history in 2 Samuel, Solomon and David displaced, and Absalom in power.
M.H.T. Do we see the contrast between those that the elect lady was warned not to receive into the house, in the second epistle and those whom we ought to receive in the third epistle? It says "receive such, that we may be fellow workers with the truth".
S.McC. That is good. The second letter stresses those that we are not to receive, but the third letter stresses those that we are to receive. It is important therefore to see Demetrius in that light, as one who has witness borne to him by all, and by the truth itself.
{25}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (2)
@Revelation 11: 3 - 13; @Revelation 12: 1 - 6; @Revelation 21: 9, 14
S.McC. The thought of unity appears in these passages in relation to the testimony; and suffering, and glory. It is important that we should see how the assembly comes on to view; especially as in chapter 12, where the enemy's hatred and activity are directed against Christ and the assembly. It may be somewhat in a hidden or abstruse way, but Christ and the assembly as we know is involved in the child caught up to God and to His throne. Then we have the thought of the Lamb's wife; trustworthiness has been acquired in the circumstances and scene of suffering, and now it is seen in her as a vessel, coming out with the glory of God, and then unity is seen pervading the whole thought of the city, as is conveyed in the numeral twelve. We know that chapter 11, which we began with, dispensationally alludes to another period of time than that in which we are, but the principles that come on to our view in the circumstances in which testimony is borne would apply in all dispensations, and they are particularly helpful at the present time in the current circumstances of the testimony. The brethren will notice that in these passages the thought of completeness enters in to what is conveyed. First, the witnesses complete their testimony; it is an important thing at the present time, that testimony should be completed and that it should not be left half-completed, whatever the sorrows or the suffering may be that it entails or involves. Then, in chapter 12, the child is brought forth, there is a completed result, and then of course, in chapter 21, the assembly comes
{26}
out, which is another completed result. After all the history throughout the dispensation and all that the assembly has had to contend with, she comes out to share with Christ in the administration.
P.L. Is this thought of completion seen in perfection in the Lord, in relation to His own suffering testimony, "Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I am perfected", and later He said, "for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem", @Luke 13: 32, 33?
S.McC. Just so. We see how the Lord completed matters in His testimony here. You remember how He said to Pilate, "I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth", @John 18: 37. The testimony before the authorities, and the powers that be would all enter into this matter of completing the testimony. The unity in the testimony is very remarkable, it speaks of "their body shall be on the street of the great city".
P.H.H. Does the completion of the testimony, as you are now speaking of it, stand somewhat connected with prophecy, that is the speaking forth in general of the mind of God?
S.McC. I think it does. And the prophetic side brings up matters in people's consciences. It says in verse 10 "they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and are full of delight, and shall send gifts to one another, because these, the two prophets, tormented them that dwell upon the earth". They were glad to see them die, glad to get rid of them, because the word of God bore in upon their consciences, and tormented them.
J.McK. Does the thought of measuring the worshippers imply that there is to be one divine standard? We have the measuring of the shrine, and the measuring of the altar, and them that
{27}
worship in it. Would the idea of what conforms to the divine standard be in mind?
S.McC. I think it does. And it is a salutary reference there, because the court without is left, it is not measured; that is, it is not a question now of dealing with Christendom at large, it is those that are in immediate nearness and responsibility to God, and even as we sit now in relation to one another, and in relation to God, we must be prepared for this measuring.
P.H.H. What connection do you see between the priestly side, and the measuring of the worshippers, and the prophetic side, as in verse 3?
S.McC. I think it shows that all these matters are interlocked. We cannot divorce them, and say they have no relation to one another; they are interlocked. That is, the service of God, and the matter of the completing of our testimony -- there is an important link in it. Then there is the matter of trade unions and testifying to the Government. There has been a good deal of disunity amongst us as to the matter of approach to the Government. Perhaps we have failed to see that it is a matter of completing testimony. We think of our dear brethren in France, prayer has been going up universally for the young men in view of the completing of their testimony, that God may make a way by His angel for them, in the National Assembly in Paris.
J.T.Jr. So Moses completed his testimony immediately. There was an extensive period, seen in Moses¬ testimony in Egypt, involving that he went in continually into the presence of Pharaoh, and finally he is told to see Pharaoh's face no more.
S.McC. It is a very interesting section to which you refer; and we see the moral courage that marked Moses. One of the great things that is needed in regard to this matter of unity in testimony is moral courage. Indeed, I think, brethren, we should face
{28}
the matter as to whether we are prepared to lose our lives, I do not mean just spiritually, I mean actually -- whether we are prepared to go that far.
A.H. Does the standing before the Lord of the earth bear on this matter?
S.McC. I think it does. Are we to allow the enemy to interfere with divine rights, to entrench upon Immanuel's realm, Immanuel's land, without raising any issue? That would not be according to faith, or to grace either. We are to remember the rights of God in this relation.
G.R.C. In @Zechariah 4 it closes by saying, "These are the two sons of oil, that stand before the Lord of the whole earth" (verse 14), and in chapter 6, as to the four chariots, the answer to the question is, "These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth", verse 5. Does that bear on what you are saying as to bearing testimony before Governments? They are responsible to the Lord of all the earth, but then the Lord of all the earth has His witnesses to bring home to them the rights of God. Is that so?
S.McC. I think that is important. The authorities represent mysteriously, agents of control, indirectly under the hand of God, in view of the testimony; and they are to be acquainted through testimony rendered, as to the rights of the Lord of all the earth. They are to be reminded through testimony to them, that God has a people here that He is supporting, and sustaining, in relation to these rights.
G.R.C. And that they themselves stand in responsibility to the God to whom witness is borne.
S.McC. That is it.
P.L. And to hold the ground for the only true and coming Heir?
S.McC. That would be it, in view of the Lord coming in, as this book from which we have read contemplates. The One who is the Heir of all.
{29}
R.W.S. Is it a daily matter in verse 3? It is not there a period of three and a half years, or a matter of so many months, but a thousand two hundred and sixty *days*. Would it suggest preparation daily for this suffering?
S.McC. Yes, it would. The protracted period of time in their prophetic service is very interesting in that sense. When it comes to verse 11, the time is limited, "And after the three days and a half the spirit of life from God came into them". In regard to the prophetic service, it is protracted and extended; but in regard to the answer to God in the completed result, which means the losing of their lives, it is limited; so we have "in three days and a half the spirit of life from God came into them", Of course it is symbolic, but the modification is interesting in that sense.
C.M.M. Would our faithfulness in claiming the earth for God lead to this giving glory to the God of heaven? The Father is spoken of in @Matthew 11 as "Lord of the heaven and of the earth". I was thinking of the pleasure of God in verse 13, and the link between "the God of the heaven" in that verse and "the Lord of the earth" in verse 4. These two witnesses are holding the earth in faithfulness, and do we not claim the earth for God? As that is so there is an answer in glory being given to God of the heavens.
S.McC. Yes, it is interesting that the remnant were filled with fear, and gave glory to the God of the heavens. While the testimony stands related to the Lord of the earth, the result works out in glory to the God of the heaven.
P.H.H. Are you suggesting that along with the much prayer that has been made about several matters, that the prophetic side and showing ourselves in testimony to the authorities should be the accompaniment? I was thinking of Elijah; James tells us
{30}
that he was a man like ourselves, and that he prayed with prayer; but in Kings, he says to Ahab, that he stood before Jehovah, and there should be no rain except by his word. Do the two things go together?
S.McC. They do. The moral courage and power that enters into that is important. Because it requires moral courage and power to carry the testimony before the authorities.
P.L. "Shew thyself to Ahab", @1 Kings 18: 1.
S.McC. Show thyself; that is it. It is not just words of mouth; it involves words coming out of the mouth, but a great deal is made of the eyes in this section. It says they *see* the witnesses; and so those in Government in high office and the like are to be impressed with the saints, and what is seen in them.
H.A.H. Is there an impression of unity in the reference to "their body" being in the singular twice?
S.McC. Yes. That is what we referred to at the beginning of the reading; the mention of the body, in the singular in that verse, would point to the unity of the testimony, although you do get their bodies in the plural in verse 9. It is a great matter that there should be unity in testimony in regard to this matter that involves the rights of the Lord. And it would encourage us to see, and encourage our brethren to see, in the Scriptures that have been referred to, the great system of divine help, and divine support, that lies behind the testimony rendered.
C.H. And alongside of that, the acceptance of the principle of martyrdom, which this testimony might involve?
S.McC. I feel we have to face that matter, I speak feelingly -- we would all speak feelingly about this matter. I must say it has come up in one's own soul, as to whether we are prepared to accept martyrdom if it means an issue in the public sphere,
{31}
and for the testimony. Are we? We all have to face that now.
W.J.T. Would the leverage be that it is in the place where their Lord was crucified?
S.McC. That verse is interesting as introduced by the Spirit of God through John here, because it would touch the affections, that that realm, the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, is where our Lord was crucified. It is stained with the guilt of that awful crime, and surely that would touch deeply in our souls.
C.H. We cannot isolate ourselves from what the Lord is raising in other countries, because it is being accomplished in the "brotherhood which is in the world". Should we not learn by delineation? The Lord is raising issues in certain parts, and we are all to face the principles which are involved in the experiences of others.
S.McC. So that it is a matter that we are all bound up in, in that way. That passage in Peter says, "knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which is in the world", @1 Peter 5: 9. And the word 'brotherhood', being a feminine word in the original, would mean that the subjective side, the state of the saints, is entering into it.
W.S.S. Has that been the basis on which the testimony has come down through the centuries? Paul himself speaks of being delivered unto death, and dying daily, and facing martyrdom.
S.McC. I think there is ample witness all the way down through, right to our own time as to the preparedness to accept martyrdom, if it came to the full issue as to the truth.
W.S.S. However challenging it may be, it is the truth today, that that is our place in relation to the testimony. It is a very big thing to say, but it is readiness to die, is it not?
{32}
S.McC. We have to face it. Whether we are prepared for it or not is another matter, but we have to look into it, and face it. If our Lord went that way, and if Stephen went that way, and if Antipas went that way, would we expect to stop short of anything less, if need be?
R.G.B. In the type of the Hebrew bondman, he says "I will not go free". And then of the three in Daniel it says "they would not bow". Is the same spirit of committal to the truth to be seen in us as was seen in the Lord Jesus? Our prayers may not effect deliverance, and a spirit of martyrdom is required on that account.
S.McC. I think it is. And we are tested as to our devotedness in that relation, and whether we are prepared to accept, in the spirit of unselfishness, the limitations that bondmanship may involve.
M.A.W. Would you say that perhaps deliverance may come in, as in Esther, "If I perish I perish", but was not that the way in which deliverance was effected?
S.McC. Just so. And along with that we have to face the fact, or face the prospect, that deliverance may not come in. These two witnesses, symbolic as they are, were killed, they were conquered and killed. Well, brethren throughout the world have lost their positions and jobs, in facing the matter of the trade union issue; and no deliverance has been wrought for them. We have to calculate time, and see what God has in mind.
A.H. Does what we are constitutionally enter into this? It says in verse 4, "These *are* the two olive trees and the two lamps".
S.McC. That is why we began the meetings with the subject of the water, because, if there is any dark part with us, it surely will affect the testimony, and the completing of it.
J.T.Jr. We have the principle of two here, and
{33}
while it is symbolical, there is something in the idea of two.
S.McC. Yes, there is a divine principle in it. It is referred to in other parts.
J.T.Jr. It is on that principle that the assembly has really come into evidence again.
S.McC. Yes, I suppose you have in your mind that @Matthew 18 would enter into it, "Again I say to you, that if two of you".
J.T.Jr. Two of the assembly.
W.C. Is it significant that in the last letter to the assemblies in @Revelation 3 the Lord presents Himself as "the amen", suggesting what is completed; and then as "the faithful and true witness"? In settings of indifference to what was due to Himself and of love for Him, does He represent Himself to the assembly, as "the faithful and true witness", as if He would recover the features of true witness in the assembly?
S.McC. Yes, that helps. It is interesting to see how it stands at the very beginning of the book, where the subject of witness and testimony comes up peculiarly. The assembly being publicly in the place of witness, but having failed, the Lord presents Himself to the assembly in that light, as if He would awaken the conscience of the assembly as to the matter of witness bearing, and of loyalty and faithfulness.
P.L. Would the "liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels", having such a large part in the holy compound connected with the anointing of the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony, bear on the unifying power testimonially, sufferingly, of the spirit of Christ universally, marking the saints?
S.McC. The whole system was marked by the anointing, and the chief ingredient suggests suffering in that sense. So that it would cover the whole position.
{34}
G.R.C. Does the word to Laodicea indicate that the testimony becomes the proof of our affections for Christ? It is really those who are 'hot', who can render adequate testimony, not those who are 'lukewarm'.
S.McC. So that the Lord would raise the question with them that they were neither one nor the other. Because they had become so engrossed and absorbed with material things, material goods and the like, that they were neither one nor the other. It is an important thing that we should be ardent, in that way, in our affections for Christ, and ready to complete our testimony.
G.R.C. There is a point I wonder if you could help us on. In a good many minds, I think, there has been some doubt as to whether Scripture supports us in taking the initiative in an approach to the authorities. I have had a letter recently on the subject, and there was a time when one's own mind was not clear. Some have thought that if the requirements of the authorities go against conscience, we should not say anything to them about it, but just bear the suffering involved, and some seem to feel that in approaching the authorities, and putting the truth before them, we are trying to avoid the suffering.
S.McC. I do not think it is any question of avoiding suffering. It is a question of a responsibility before God, to enlighten that which He has set up Himself, in an ordered manner in this world, and which basically and abstractly stands for the protection of His interests in it. Why should government not be enlightened? Many, I think, have thought that redress was being sought in regard to personal wrongs done on a human level. That is not the point at all. The point is that witness is to be borne to the truth; testimony is to be completed before the powers that be, the governments, in line
{35}
with what they are abstractly as ordained of God, without any question of personal redress.
G.R.C. So that in a country like France, where since the Revolution the government has apparently been marked by a non-recognition of God, it is an important matter that it should be brought to the attention of the highest authorities, that there is a body of Christian faith and steadfast devotion in that country.
S.McC. I am sure it is important that we should see that, and that our brethren should see that. Take the Huguenots, and the others, that suffered for the truth, as you go back through the years; so great was the hatred that some of them were not even allowed to be buried inside the city, and the like; then there are all the others, and what has come in since. Are the brethren now going to be behind in drawing the Government's attention to what God has under His hand at the present time, that which is prepared to go to the wall, to maintain the divine principles in the testimony?
P.L. And has not God ordered all the circumstances in which the nations now find themselves, and allowed the demands which they make, to force into evidence what God has here in their midst?
S.McC. Yes.
A.J.G. The Lord before Pilate said, "Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above", @John 19: 11. Was He calling Pilate's attention in that way to Pilate's own responsibility to God?
S.McC. That is it exactly. He puts the matter back on Pilate, and in our testimony in the United States, to the Government, and appeal in regard to the truth, it has been putting back on them a sense of their responsibility to God, that there is a people in their midst that is thinking of God, and is prepared to die for principles that are according to God.
{36}
J.McK. In connection with this matter of power given to the two witnesses, I think the word is 'efficacy'. Would there be with the witnesses the ability to bring the thing specifically to the conscience of authorities?
S.McC. I think that is the point. It is not done in a vague way, but, as you say, something specific has to be done, and something specific has to be said, along with prayer and fasting.
J.McK. And not merely for relief, but in order that the truth might be borne witness to.
S.McC. I think that is the point, I might just read one or two passages in the Acts as to Paul. The question of whether it was right or wrong to appeal to Caesar comes up in our minds. It is interesting that before Paul made the appeal to Caesar in chapter 25: 11, it says in chapter 23: 11, "the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also", The Lord was in that matter and overruling things in view of the witness to be borne at Rome. The truth thus is specially in mind.
W.J.T. Ananias had a message for him in relation to it, that he was to bear His name before nations and kings and the sons of Israel, "for I will shew him how much he must suffer for my name", @Acts 9: 16.
S.McC. Just so. Then in @Acts 27: 23 it says (and this is the scripture; this is not what I say, or anyone else is saying, this is the scripture), "For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar", Think of some of the brethren that there might have been that had misgivings or reserves about Paul going to Caesar, when all heaven was behind him in the matter!
R.G.B. So in @2 Timothy 4, where he speaks about
{37}
appearing before Caesar, he says, "But the Lord stood with me, and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made", verse 17, I wondered if that bore on your thought as to the completion of the testimony.
S.McC. Very good. "Fully made" would link on with the completing of the testimony here.
J.T.Jr. In the chapter you have referred to in Acts, Paul's sister's son was really the one through whom the relief came to Paul. Does that show how things that are right may start in a small way, otherwise Paul might have been slain?
S.McC. That is very good. We might say in such instances, Well, why not count on God and just pray? But then there are all these methods of operations that the Spirit of God brings before us, and we are not to make little of them, in that sense, small as they may be.
P.H.H. It was possibly Paul's prayers that brought this young man forward.
S.McC. No doubt it was.
M.A.W. Do you think therefore that in chapter 16, Paul was right when he speaks of having been beaten publicly uncondemned and then insisting that the praetors themselves should come to release them?
S.McC. Well, they are just the facts, that what they did was not right; and, while it may be thought that Paul was standing on his dignity, we have to bear in mind that the government, and men in government, have to be reminded of what is right, and the due processes of law.
W.H. Would that be seen in John the baptist's word to Herod in regard of Herodias, "It is not lawful for thee to have her"? Did he not lose his life for his testimony?
S.McC. And it is very interesting in that relation, if I remember rightly, in @Matthew 14 the verb in the Greek is the imperfect tense, according to the note
{38}
that Mr. Darby gives. Literally it is, 'kept on saying'. That is, you keep at it; you are not dismayed if there is evil resistance, or lawless resistance to prophetic service and testimony. You keep at the thing, keep on at it.
W.McK. Does the thought of standing enter into that? It says of the witnesses in @Revelation 11 that they "*stand* before the Lord of the earth", and then, verse 11, "they *stood* upon their feet". It was not a time for lying on their faces, although that might come in in other regards.
S.McC. That is important, because God said to Joshua, "Wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?" @John 7: 10. There is time for lying on the earth, lying on our face, but then there is a time for standing on our feet.
A.J.G. You were saying that there must be the keeping on at it. In verse 11 of chapter 10, John says, "And it was said to me, Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings". It is as though he was told he must keep on at it.
S.McC. Just so.
P.L. And the importunate widow in Luke?
S.McC. Exactly. She was heard because of her importunity. We may wonder, as some of us have wondered, at the long delay; but then, shall we give up, shall we not keep at it in importunity?
C.M.M. Would you advise us to emphasise conscience when before these people? They have consciences themselves.
S.McC. I think that is very important, because that is what the people do not like; the tormenting in verse 10 has to do with the conscience. It is the keen edge of the prophetic word on their conscience that they do not like. And when they are reminded of conscience it bothers them, like the gnats in
{39}
Egypt, it is a source of annoyance, a source of irritation.
A.H. The prophets were clothed with sackcloth irrespective of the firmness of their communication. Would you say a word about that?
S.McC. I think an important feature comes in there, that we should be marked by what is comely, and by a sense of humility and dependence so that the governments of the world can see that there is a different kind of humanity. It is not the kind of humanity that will be consummated in the man of sin, but the kind of humanity that was seen in Jesus.
J.S.E. Would you say a word, please, as to the bearing of the Lord's own ministry? I think it is in the early part of @Luke 12, as to the place the Spirit has in helping us as to standing before these agencies.
S.McC. I think it links with the olive tree here. You are referring to the fact that the Spirit speaks, as it says in @Luke 12: 11, "when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and the authorities, be not careful how or what ye shall answer, or what ye shall say; for the Holy Spirit shall teach you *in the hour itself* what should be said". I think there would be a link with the olive trees in that, that the testimony is rendered in the power of the Spirit.
W.S.S. You have referred once or twice to the importance of what is here. You spoke of it in connection with France, for example, and I was wondering about the opening verses of the chapter, the measuring of the temple, and the altar, and them that worship in it. It raises a question with us as to our appreciation of what is here, and what is ascending to God from the altar, and the service of God carried on. Would not that be very strengthening to us to have before our affections in all testimonial positions?
S.McC. It would indeed. It shows that God has taken account of what there is. It may be in a small
{40}
way, but He has taken account of it in relation to His own pleasure in it.
W.S.S. I was thinking of the importance of our taking account of it also.
S.McC. Well, that is important too, for John says, "There was given to me a reed like a staff, saying, Rise and measure the temple of God".
P.L. Would @1 Corinthians 13 suggest what is measurable -- love, and chapter 14 the prophetic word issuing out of that?
S.McC. Yes.
P.H.H. Would you say a word about the next part, as connected with this? We have, the voice out of heaven, in verse 12, for instance, and the invitation to "Come up here". Is that heaven intervening as a kind of crowning approval of their sufferings and pathway in this testimony?
S.McC. It is very fine how heaven says "Come up here". They did not want them down there; they were glad to get rid of them, and sent gifts to one another because they thought they had got rid of them; but heaven says "Come up *here*". It is not just 'Come up', but "Come up *here*". The location of the place, "Come up here", and they went up to heaven in a cloud. That is, there is a correspondence with the Master, for He went up in the cloud.
J.T.Jr. So it is a very interesting thought that these two really form part of the heavenly order of things. That is, they are not an earthly family, they form a heavenly one.
S.McC. Just so. That is, heaven says of persons that have completed their testimony in the sense in which we have been referring to it, "Come up here", because they are part of the heavenly order of things.
A.N.G. Does it actually show that what has been given testimony to is heavenly in its character? Mr. Taylor used to say that while Paul claimed
{41}
Roman citizenship in the prison in Philippi, in his epistle to the Philippians he said "Our commonwealth has its existence in the heavens".
S.McC. Exactly. So that we are all tested as to where our interests are, because we cannot expect to have power in prophetic testimony and witness if our interests are bound up in the earth, and bound up in the world.
C.J.H.D. Does @Nehemiah 2: 4 give an example of a successful appeal to the authorities? There is testimony as to the city lying waste, and then the king says, "For what dost thou make request?" Nehemiah says, "So I prayed to the God of the heavens. And I said to the king ...".
S.McC. Well, that is an encouragement to us in regard to these matters that we have been speaking about. We should be encouraged to approach the authorities in view of these particular matters that require the intervention of the authorities, for God may have gone before us; He may have sent His angel, and have been working with the authorities, and we may find favour as we come to them.
A.J.G. So that the king said to Nehemiah, "Why is thy face sad?" Is not that like the sackcloth with these witnesses?
S.McC. That is it. We feel this matter; it enters into our beings, that God's rights should be disputed, and that the liberty of Christian conscience should be denied. We feel that, and the authorities should get a sense of the fact that we feel it.
A.P.C.L. According to Romans we are subject to the authorities for conscience sake. Should not there be the impression given of that, and that it is distressing to us that we cannot be subject to them for conscience sake, because they are standing out against God?
S.McC. Just so. And do you not think "for conscience sake" would also apply to this matter of
{42}
completing testimony? It is right that the government should be enlightened as to the fact that there is that which God has here which can be called attention to in testimony.
A.P.C.L. So that it is a matter of an enlightened conscience that is brought to bear upon them.
S.McC. That is it.
E.E.H. How do you regard the word in @Acts 5, "God must be obeyed rather than men"?
S.McC. That is what we have to recognise when it comes to a full issue as to the truth, that God must be obeyed rather than men. We have to be prepared to stand by what we have conviction in regard to, in relation to the rights of God and our consciences.
F.V.W. Would it be seen in Daniel? On the one hand Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself, and, on the other hand, he requested certain things of the prince of the eunuchs; and then it says, "And God granted Daniel favour and mercy".
S.McC. That section helps in regard to the matter, and it becomes very challenging to us, as to whether we are clear in regard to matters. How can we approach the government in regard to matters if we are not clear in our own circumstances and lives of what would be defiling in regard to unions and associations and the like.
A.E.M. If there are two of them in the country you could approach the authorities on the ground of the assembly.
S.McC. That would be the point in @Matthew 18, "if two of you shall agree". That is, if two persons of the assembly, having the assembly interests at heart, approach the authorities in that light, they can count upon divine help.
C.H. Would faithfulness of this kind make way for the power of God in life? God seems to come into it in verse 11 after a certain period.
S.McC. It is very interesting how it is put there,
{43}
"And after the three days and a half the spirit of life from God came into them". Now notice, it does not say 'it was *sent* into them', it says "it *came* into them", I think the 'coming into them' shows the condition that there was there in affinity with it.
J.T.Jr. Would you think that morally they would have to go through death first? I mean we have to go through death morally before we know what the spirit of life from God is.
S.McC. I am sure that is right.
C.H. They were not caught up to heaven immediately. It says "they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them". Before they were caught up to heaven they evidently were a testimony to the power of life.
S.McC. That all contains important principles for us at the present time, not only in regard to our brethren who are suffering in France, and we think of them feelingly, but in other parts of the world.
We must go on now to the woman here in chapter 12. Perhaps now we come to what comes nearer home in regard to conditions in our localities involving the necessity of the maternal side, and the necessity of a completed result in this relation. So that right results are arrived at, as it says, "she brought forth a male son", and then "her child was caught up to God and to his throne". The thought of unity is conveyed in the crown of twelve stars upon her head; it is unity in an administrative or governmental setting.
P.H.H. May I ask you a little more about this maternal side? Did you say earlier that the assembly is included in the male son? How does the maternal side work out in connection with that?
S.McC. I suppose the inclusion of the assembly in the male son would be an abstract thought (we are to learn how to hold abstract thoughts), but the woman in travail would be a very concrete thought.
{44}
Although there are certain abstract features linked with her, the travail would be very concrete and it raises the question as to whether we are working out deliverance with completed results accruing in the child being brought forth.
P.L. And is that what the enemy is set against -- divine matters fruitfully brought to a spiritual conclusion?
S.McC. He always is against that; as we have said already today, having been defeated in the open battlefield, he will come in in a seductive way; and he will hinder the saints going all the way in the judgment of evil, or in the solving of issues as to evil. If he can get them to stop half way he has gained the day as far as the matter is concerned.
C.M.M. Is right administration arrived at by the development of the maternal side amongst us? I was thinking of Lemuel's mother and the prophecy that she taught him; @Proverbs 31: 1. And then Rachel said, "Jehovah will add to me another son", @Genesis 30: 24.
S.McC. That strengthens the thought of unity in this matter, because the completing of the twelve was in Benjamin, and it was through travail and sorrow.
J.McK. I was wondering about your reference to chapter 12. Does it come in over against chapter 11, where there has been faithfulness? Heaven now proceeds with its own thoughts and gives power for carrying them into effect.
S.McC. I think so. And it is a great thing that we should hold to heaven's thoughts. The woman here was "clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars". These are glorious thoughts that we have to cling to, and not give them up. However much the power of evil may be present, we hold to these heavenly thoughts.
J.McK. Is it not important that the sign is seen
{45}
in the heaven? Things have to be met on earth, and are met in testimony, but heaven unveils its great proposals, and its power to bring them all into effect, and to care for what is on earth, too.
S.McC. What mystery would attach to this! The human mind would be baffled by it, but God would enlighten us as to what enters into this great matter of the woman seen in this glory, and the child that is to be brought forth -- a definite result.
W.W.S. So that travail would be a much deeper and more intensive exercise than wearing the sackcloth. Does the bringing forth involve these deep, secret exercises?
S.McC. It does, and all the power of heaven is behind the woman to help her. Christ is in mind, in the male son, and the assembly too, and the devil is against it for the red dragon is standing before the woman. The proximity of the dragon is to be noticed; we should be reminded, in that way, of how near the enemy is to attack this thought.
A.H. Is that the enemy religiously?
S.McC. Say something more what is in your mind.
A.H. I was wondering whether there is some mysterious reference to this religious element that is really set against the man child.
S.McC. Of course the religious side is linked with it, as we see in the details of the mystery of iniquity as it works out; but the political side is involved in it too as we see in Herod in the early chapters of Matthew. You have got a link between the two, the political side and the religious side.
G.R.C. So that when it speaks of the male child being "caught up to God and to his throne", does not that involve the priest and the king -- "caught up to God", is the priest, "and to his throne", the king? And do not those two thoughts -- kings and priests -- run through the book; and is not the enemy's attack against that?
{46}
S.McC. It is interesting to see that. As if the enemy is against royalty, and against priestliness among the brethren.
G.R.C. That is what I had in mind; they are the two great qualities required in testimony.
S.McC. Yes.
A.E.B. In chapter 10: 7 it says "the mystery of God shall be completed". Are not all these things that we have been speaking about working out in those days? Would you say a further word about it?
S.McC. We know that chapter 11 completes the historical side, "The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come, and he shall reign to the ages of ages". When we begin chapter 12, we come to the details that are wrought out in the scenes that have been described symbolically in the previous chapters.
J.S.E. Do you suggest in your allusions to the woman, the unified exercises of the saints in relation to Christ and His rights?
S.McC. I thought so. That is what was in one's mind, and especially the matter of bringing forth the male son. The enemy does not want administration according to God. He does not want government according to God, or royalty according to God, because he knows that that means his overthrow. He is thus ready to devour it, to spoil it and to destroy it, if he can. But he cannot.
A.J.G. Hence all the exercises in the local assemblies at the present time have in mind the development of this ability to shepherd in a right way in the day to come.
S.McC. That is it. At the present time the principle of the male son would work out in royalty according to God, as seen in this dispensation, grace reigns through righteousness unto eternal life.
G.R.C. So that the exercises assemblywise have
{47}
been concentrated a good deal upon the development of priesthood amongst the saints, the service of God, which would link with her child being caught up to God, but we need further help specially perhaps, now, on royalty, the power that would carry the testimony in the way you have been speaking.
S.McC. I think it is very important. I find in moving around amongst the saints, and in observing conditions, that there is great need for the male son, great need for moral power, moral courage to maintain the truth, and to face things in regard to the truth, and all that is inconsistent with our heavenly position, or with our pilgrimage and sojourning here.
P.L. Does the Spirit urge the intensity of the thought, in the dual expression "male son"?
S.McC. It is remarkable. It would have been sufficient to have said she brought forth a son, but it says she brought forth a "*male* son", that is, the matter is intensified. The remnant say, in the prophet Isaiah, "We have been in travail, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought the deliverance of the land, neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen", @Isaiah 26: 18. Here, instead of bringing forth wind, we have got a definite result, "a male son, who shall shepherd all the nations".
R.W.S. Would the thought of associations be a little more delicate than the matter of trade unions, and would the throne and the idea of royalty, that have been alluded to, bear upon it?
S.McC. I think so, I think the Lord is helping us to review all matters at the present time. A time of grace, and a time of patience is given, but there is need to look into all matters; professional associations and business associations need to be looked into. We are not saying that everything is wrong, but it is a question of looking into matters, and seeing what involves compromise of the truth.
{48}
E.J.B. And every locality should have the same aspect in relation to it?
S.McC. That is what we have in mind in unity. So that in @Revelation 21, the Lamb's wife comes on to our view. The holy city is identified as the Lamb's wife, and unity marks the whole position. Wherever you look, you are reminded of the unity that enters into the position in the number twelve.
J.S.E. Is it presented as the spiritual outcome of the exercises that have already been touched?
S.McC. I thought it was. The allusion to the seven angels, and the seven bowls, full of the seven last plagues, would throw us back in our thoughts to what has gone before.
J.S.E. I thought the allusion to the Lamb's wife would involve the road of moral exercises being completed, and she is qualified to have that position on that ground.
S.McC. Just so. She has come through, over against the false woman, the whore that is judged, and she is a trustworthy confidante of the Lamb, of Christ. The other one does not go through. The violent man in Proverbs does not go through and the seductive woman does not go through, but this woman goes through, and the male son goes through.
G.R.C. Is there any help in looking back at chapter 15: 5 - 8, in this connection, because it says "And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in the heaven was opened; and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure bright linen ..." The temple of the tabernacle of witness points to the assembly, of course, and the tabernacle of witness is here at the moment, but according to this verse it is in heaven, and these seven angels with the seven plagues come out of the temple of the tabernacle. That is, you come out as you may say, from the very
{49}
heart of the assembly, of course, the presence of God, and it says in verse 8, "And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power". It is as though the assembly is entirely in accord with these seven angels going forth -- filled with smoke. It is in sympathy with God in His judgments. That precedes what we are on now, and I wondered whether it helped at all.
S.McC. I think it is important to see in that sense the link between the moral side, and the spiritual side here, in the Lamb's wife; we cannot, as it were, divorce the two. While they may be separate departments, the one leads into the other, so that we must be right morally if we are going to move in power spiritually in kingship, and in priesthood in administration and the service of God.
W.S.S. In chapter 18 it says, "Rejoice over her, heaven, and ye saints and apostles and prophets; for God has judged your judgment upon her". I was thinking of that in connection with the remark as to the necessity of the saints being in communion with God in regard to the moral conditions around.
S.McC. It is very important that we should be in accord with heaven's judgment of matters. It says of certain "they shall be priests of God", not priests *to* God, but "they shall be priests *of* God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years". That is, priesthood is blending with royalty in the administration of the kingdom.
J.T.Jr. While it may appear that the assembly is out of sight, in the previous chapters, from chapter 4 to the one we have now read, actually she is there all the time.
S.McC. Do not you think that that is very helpful and important in regard to the present dispensation? We may have thought that the assembly was out of sight, in certain periods, but she is there all the time.
{50}
A.P.C.L. Is verse 10 important in view of our seeing this matter, "And he carried me away in the Spirit, and set me on a great and high mountain"? So many people say they cannot see these things.
S.McC. That is a good point to finish with. We need to see how near the Spirit is to us in regard to these things, and how available He is to us, to help us to see the assembly and what the assembly is to Christ in this light.
{51}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (3)
@1 John 1: 1 - 7; @John 4: 31 - 38; @John 6: 66 - 71
S.McC. The feature of our subject which we are considering together, namely spiritual unity in the ministry of John, will bear this morning on the ministry and the ministers, and also on the saints, too, as affected by the ministry and the ministers. In all these passages the subject of the ministers and the ministry comes up, and what we may be helped to see is how this thought of eternal life appears, in this relation in all the passages that we have read, and I suppose one of the thoughts in mind in regard to what we are now considering would be to see that it is essential that the thought of quality should be maintained. Being what we are, in the human condition that we are in, as the great thoughts of God come into our minds and into our hearts, they may become attenuated in our appreciation of them. It is not that the truth itself becomes attenuated, but in our apprehension and appreciation of it, and in result, the quality is lowered. The dignity of the verses read in John's first epistle is very remarkable; we have the fellowship of the Father and the Son, and the fellowship of the apostles, and the distinctive plane and platform on which they stood with the Father and the Son; and then our fellowship with them, through what is reported in the power of the Spirit coming to us, and finally our fellowship with one another. It all shows how this thought of spiritual unity is in mind in the promulgation of the testimony which the verses we have read set out. Then in @John 4, we have the harvest, and the sower and the reaper, the emphasis
{52}
being on the "together", and how the sower and the reaper are bound up together, and how the Lord, perhaps, would keep us humble, and lowly in what He says, in that we have entered into the labours of others. The Lord goes a long way up the stream of time in referring to the labours that had gone before, but it is all one, in the divine mind and outlook, and we come into it in that light. So that we are to be reminded in that sense of what the Lord says, "I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours". That may be carried down morally and spiritually, even to the days of the revival, for that is our position today; we have entered into the labours of others, and the great exercise would be, at least in oneself and I suppose in all of us, that the quality might be maintained in the assembly. Then lastly in @John 6 we see the way the Lord turns to the twelve and challenges those that remain. There were those that had gone away, but there are those that are left, and the Lord challenges the twelve as to their position in relation to the truth. And we get that word of Peter, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". Then there is the Lord's scathing reference to Judas, as if we are early acquainted in John's gospel as to the element seen in Judas, where it springs from, so that we should be alive to it, and aware of it, in view of the preservation of the spiritual unity that we are considering. The thought of quality in these verses in John's first epistle is very important.
J.T.Jr. The "we" that comes in the first epistle would be the apostles, I suppose, and that they were united in what they were saying.
S.McC. That would be a very important matter with ourselves, as the principle comes down. We see
{53}
what is distinctive in that way, to the apostles, but it would have a reflex right down to the assembly.
J.T.Jr. So that we get a pattern in the way the Lord set up things in the apostles, which we would not assume to be in our day, in the same sense, but the spirit of it is what the Lord has set up; it should be united.
S.McC. It is the important feature which the Lord would stress over against what the enemy is doing in the mystery of iniquity, in seeking to unite that which really displaces the doctrine of the Christ. The doctrine of the Christ involves the revelation of God coming out in a ministry of Christ in the ministry of the apostles.
A.J.G. So that the early believers persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. Would that ensure unity, and the quality that you spoke of?
S.McC. It would. And the Spirit has come, and remains here; He has not left the position, despite what has come into the dispensation. He came in @Acts 2, and He remains all the way through the dispensation, and His great end is that that quality should be maintained in the assembly, in the saints.
T.J.G. Do we get the idea of quality in verse 1, seen in the intimate and substantial communion with the Lord Jesus Himself?
S.McC. We are reminded in these verses of eternal life in testimony here, and the Lord's place in manhood, and of that wonderful plane of things seen in the Father and the Son where eternal life was witnessed to in such a unique and remarkable way. Think of the level of it, the dignity of it, the quality of it! Then, we are to see it work down to the matter of the apostles, because, as John says later, it is not only what was true in Christ, but what is true in us. The same quality is to go through yet, keeping in mind what is unique in relation to the Father and the Son, and to the apostolic position.
{54}
A.J.G. So that in @John 17 the Lord says, speaking to His Father, "the words", that is the divine communications, "which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them". Does that show the distinctiveness of the fellowship that the apostles enjoyed, that the communications which the Lord was constantly receiving from His Father, He passed on to them?
S.McC. I am sure it does, I had thought earlier to read in @Revelation 21, to see how the twelve apostles of the Lamb stand out in the twelve foundations of the city, but our time is limited and we have quite a few scriptures on hand. We are not, however, to forget, nor to lose sight of, how the dispensation has been founded in relation to the uniqueness of their position, and their ministry.
C.M.M. Would Peter standing up with the eleven, in @Acts 2, give character to this principle from the very start?
S.McC. It would. There we see the authority that enters into the apostolic teaching and doctrine. Peter was fully supported by the eleven; there was no thought of any subverting of what Peter was saying. He stands up with the eleven; he was fully with the eleven, and the eleven were fully with him.
H.C. We have in @Ephesians 2 what is built upon "the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone". Is that a reference to the quality you are speaking of?
S.McC. Yes, it would point to that, because the apostles have a peculiar place in the foundation. Paul comes in later in his own distinctive setting in regard to the heavenly side, but the twelve stand out in these verses in the uniqueness of their part in the fellowship that they had with the Father and the Son.
G.R.C. Does the Lord's first request for unity in @John 17: 11 bear on this, "Holy Father, keep them
{55}
in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we"? Does not that refer to the apostles, and the unities that follow among the saints generally would depend on that coming first?
S.McC. Exactly. There are three features of unity as we know, that stand out in @John 17, and that first one particularly sets out the unity linked with the apostolic position.
G.R.C. Is it not a marvellous thing that the dispensation began with twelve men of whom there is no record of any disunity or friction?
S.McC. It is a very remarkable thing. And the fact that that number is so expanded on our view, in the assembly and the holy city, would show what a unified result there is in public testimony in the vessel, the city.
W.S.S. Is it important for us to see that the spiritual unity, and the quality that accompanies it, actually existed in the early days described in the Acts of the Apostles.
S.McC. The early days of the Acts help us to see the quality that there was amongst the saints, and our concern should be that that quality should not deteriorate in us, as coming in at the end. While we know there is weakness publicly and a good deal that brings sorrow to our minds and hearts as to the position publicly, we always remember that the Spirit of God has never left the position. He is still here, and the quality that He brought in, and that the dispensation was inaugurated in relation to, is to be sustained through to the end. Therefore it becomes a challenge, I think to all of us, as to whether it is being maintained, or whether there is deterioration with us.
P.H.H. Is that what is in mind in the word 'report', (verse 3), "that which we have seen and heard we report to you"? The note says "'Bring back the report of', from something we have learnt", Does
{56}
that guarantee, so to speak, along with the Spirit's presence, that there is no deterioration?
S.McC. Just so. The Spirit of God, while not formally referred to in this section, underlies the whole matter as it is communicated to others. As the report comes down, the Spirit of God is in it, and thus the pure, and right strain in quality is maintained.
A.J.G. Does the message in verse 5 come in with a view to preserving the quality, "that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all"?
S.McC. I thought so. And we have the reference to the blood of Christ in this particular relation, as cleansing us from all sin. These two great thoughts are brought in, so that we might be saved from the allowance of anything, whether it be darkness or sin, that in its operation with us, would detract from the quality that the Spirit of God would maintain right through to the end.
J.McK. Do we have to go back to the relations between the Father and the Son for the character of it? I was thinking of the way it was presented, "the eternal life which was with the Father". Is that the character and quality flowing from an understanding of that life?
S.McC. I think it is. How precious it is to think of the eternal life that is witnessed to in that environment! What eternal life was to the Father, in the fulness of manhood, seen in Jesus, the Son, in humanity here! What it was to the Father; the quality of it! We have the life that was in God's purpose for men, coming on to our view, in the fulness of Christ's manhood. Although it was there from the time of infancy, the scripture particularly refers to the manifestation of it, in relation to the fulness of manhood seen in Jesus -- "a glory as of an only-begotten with a father". Our souls are to be affected by that.
{57}
J.O.T.D. Does the expression in verse 4, "These things write we to you that your *joy* may be full" indicate the provision with the apostles and the Spirit, for the saints to be in the fulness of this throughout the dispensation?
S.McC. It is a great matter that things should be full with us. The enemy wants to hinder this arrival at what is full. You will remember that yesterday reference was made in the epistle to "full wages". John says to the elect lady, "See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive *full* wages". And here we have full joy in mind. As things come down, in the report, and then the message, there is to be no deterioration; the saints should reach full joy. And this raises a question in regard to the ministry and to the ministers as to whether things are rightly sustained if the saints are to come into full joy.
Ques. Would the contrast to this be seen in the report of the spies in @Numbers 13?
S.McC. You mean in the unbelieving ones, but the quality of it was maintained in Caleb and Joshua. That is what we want to get our eye on. It may not have been maintained in all, but the point is to see where it is maintained.
E.C.L. Do you think that Paul gives us an example of what you are saying when he went up to Jerusalem to lay before those there what he had? He says in @Galatians 2, "lest in any way I run or had run in vain". He is comparing, so to speak, what he had, and whether it linked on with the apostles at Jerusalem.
S.McC. I think it is very interesting to see that line in Paul, and how he was concerned that things should not deteriorate with him. He was very careful even about his own body, lest he should become a castaway, lest the truth should be discredited in that way. One is specially thinking of the practical
{58}
bearing of all this amongst us; there are a lot of meetings, a lot of fellowship meetings, and three-day meetings; and there are these meetings here. Well, it is very challenging to us, at least it is to oneself, as to whether quality is to be maintained, by the Spirit, so that there is no attenuation, no weakening in result, in relation to the truth.
P.H.H. Does that open the question about the report, that which we have seen and heard? Is it some kind of independency of thought or view which brings in this deterioration -- not maintaining the level of what is seen and heard?
S.McC. I think it is. I am sure, I speak from my own side, that those of us that have served, we may go down the list, and see all that we are committed to, and what we have in mind to do; but are we concerned that the quality linked with these verses should be carried through? It is important that it should be, if the saints are to be rightly affected in regard to spiritual unity.
M.A.W. Is that what Peter is concerned about in @Acts 1, in the kind of man that would be needed to fill the twelfth place?
S.McC. Look what care there was, as to the selection, especially as we think of what had transpired in relation to Judas, who had defected so badly. The Lord indicates early in John's gospel the quality in Judas, that he was a devil. Well, that is a very strong statement, but the Lord is indicating the kind of quality that is in Judas. And the disciples were very concerned in the selection of one to take his place, that there should be the right kind of quality in the minister.
G.P. Is this matter of quality guarded by Paul in @2 Corinthians 1, when he says "the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus, and Timotheus)"? He does not only leave it at "us", but names the persons.
{59}
S.McC. I think that is very helpful at this juncture, because it was over against the abundance of gift and ministry that there was in Corinth. We know how in the world, and with the leaders in Corinth, things became attenuated, the truth was watered down and weakened, through a false ministry, in which the devil was finding a right of way. But Paul projects on to their view the quality of the ministry in persons known and named, and the unity that marked them -- Paul, Silvanus and Timotheus.
M.H.T. In the opening of the Acts, we have the reference to Peter and John going up together to the temple, and then the word, "Look on us", and then "Silver and gold I have not; but what I have, this give I to thee", And then we have the man holding Peter and John.
S.McC. That brings up the matter of results. What are the results? Peter and John were seen in such brotherly relations; they were so unified, they could say "Look on us". There was no dark spot with them, no disuniting influence -- "Look on us". And we see the result. They were not depending upon, or building up on reputation. The amount of meetings that we take, or the amount of articles that we may write, or have published in the monthlies in themselves do not ensure quality. If the quality is not in the person, certainly the magazines will not impart the quality. It is important that the quality should be maintained with those of us who serve.
W.S.S. In verse 1 of the epistle it says "That which we have contemplated". Would that not bring them into accord with the Father in His thoughts of His beloved Son? And would not that give quality to their service?
S.McC. I am sure it would. Therefore it behoves us to consider what was referred to in verse 5, that is, a message is how things are coming to us, and
{60}
coming down to us, "that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all". Well, that searches me. Is there any darkness in me? There is no darkness in God, but is there any darkness in me that would hinder the quality of the ministry?
W.S.S. Hinder our contemplation of all that has shone forth in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ.
S.McC. That is it. Is there anything that might darken the revelation of God in the apprehension of it in our souls as we might say, speaking broadly?
G.R.C. So that the superlative quality lies in the fact that the Word has become flesh, a divine Person has set it out. Would you say a word in that connection as to the meaning of the beginning here, "that which was from the beginning"?
S.McC. I think he is alluding to what has come in in relation to Christ, His coming into manhood. The neuter word 'that' refers to the substantial character of that which appeared in this world, as Christ came on to the scene in manhood. "The beginning" thus refers to what we have in the gospels -- Christ in manhood.
J.T.Jr. The expanse that you referred to last night comes in in the beginning of Scripture.
S.McC. It does, and as time works out we see how God's original thought as to the expanse has been tampered with, so that the enemy comes into it, and persons under his influence come into it. Ultimately all that will be met; but I think, as perhaps you would think too, that the question would be raised with all of us as to how we are in it.
J.T.Jr. I would think, therefore, the conflict enters into the expanse, because the references you made last night fit in with what we have got here, in relation to the apostles. Actually the apostles were in the expanse, and they were to set out the authoritative side of things, which of course, as you say, was tampered with. It was tampered with in
{61}
the Lord's life even, but also it came in later, in the apostles¬ own history.
S.McC. I am sure we should note carefully this matter in these verses as to "in him is no darkness at all", and "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie" -- John is very specific, and very defined in what he says -- "and do not practise the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin". We are to be free from darkness, and we are to be free from sin.
G.R.C. Is that what is in mind in the reference to the expanse? Do you mean that if we walk in the light as He is in the light, it is like the greater light set in the heavens, on the fourth day typically pointing to God and light as to Him in full expression?
S.McC. That is what I thought. The expanse contains the ruling class according to God, but then, how did Hymenaeus and Philetus get there? How did Jannes and Jambres get there? That shows how the divine thought has been entrenched upon by evil, wicked men, who have erred as to the truth.
J.M. Paul says in @2 Corinthians 4: 2, "But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God". Does that bear on what you are saying?
S.McC. I understand that is the idea of the expanse. That bears on the expanse, the manifestation, where the ruling class will be manifested and displayed. The world to come will be a great expression of that. So that it is important that we get help from God, beginning with ourselves, every one of us, to reject the hidden things of shame, to reject the features of darkness that the enemy would bring into our souls.
{62}
C.J.H.D. Ezekiel, in chapter 1, in a dark day, sees the expanse as the look of the terrible crystal. Would that bear on the need of absolute purity in regard of the expanse?
S.McC. It would. So that we have the allusion to the blood of Jesus Christ, and then, in the part that was not read, to the advocacy of Christ. Surely it is to touch our affections, and to touch our souls, that such divine provision has been made, that the quality of the life that has been witnessed to in the humanity of Jesus, and carried down through the apostles, should be maintained in us, free from the darkening influences that the enemy operates by and through.
T.J.G. Would you say something on the word 'cleanseth' in this connection, having in mind that it is blood, and not water?
S.McC. Well, it is the value and efficacy of the blood here, not the water. Because, what is being stressed in the first chapter of the epistle of John, is objective testimony; we have reports, messages, it is objective testimony presented for faith, and the blood is therefore stressed here. The water has to do with our state, and the subjective side, but the blood has to do with the objective side.
W.McK. Would this word "in him" have an inward bearing on us? That is, "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all".
S.McC. Well, it is to reflect on us in that way, as to whether there is any darkness in us; it is a solemn thing if darkness is allowed in us. If it is not judged, if the efficacy of the blood of Christ is not appreciated, or if the advocacy of Christ is not made way for and is not resultful in our souls, the darkness may deepen, as it generally does. One of the most distressing things is to see, as some of us have seen in other parts of the world, how the darkness deepens in those that
{63}
go out of fellowship, and leave the truth. The darkness deepens in their souls.
W.McK. Would the vital matter therefore be our inward links with the Spirit, the Person who is in us, to maintain this feature?
S.McC. I think it is important, as we have said, that while the Spirit is not alluded to formally. He underlies this matter of how we are to be sustained in regard to what is set before us in testimony in these verses.
R.G.B. Are we to be encouraged in the sense that the divine system of help is fully equal to the maintenance of the divine standard? I was thinking of the blood of Christ, and the advocacy of Christ and the presence of the Spirit.
S.McC. It touches you to think of the much provision that has been made that we might be free, and clear of all that would hinder our being in the gain of what has come down to us.
W.C. Would there be the thought in the last Psalm, "Praise him in the firmament" or 'expanse' as the note says, "of his power"? God triumphs and secures, at the end, what is in keeping with His own thoughts in the expanse. He gets the full answer in praise and worship.
S.McC. It is important that we have that in our souls, that while the enemy has invaded the expanse, it will eventually be cleared, and God will show publicly the victory that has been won.
P.H.H. Would the expression used by Paul in @2 Timothy 2: 2, help in this, "the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also"? Would that ensure that the pure line of quality comes right down to our own time, when the apostles have gone? We still have the faithful men.
S.McC. That is what Paul has in mind. Things
{64}
are to be continued and the truth is to be handed down without attenuation, without weakening, right through to the end of the dispensation. There is no thought of reduction in the quality.
A.E.M. I would like to ask you a question, although it may take us back a bit. We got away from a suggestion that Mr. Taylor ministered some years ago, not to take fellowship meetings at a long date. We have some brothers who enter into engagements nine months ahead. What do you say about that?
S.McC. Perhaps the passage in @John 4 will now help us. The Lord brings in the matter of time, "Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes?" The Lord brings in the period of four months, as to the harvest. We might liken it to what we are doing, and what we are engaging in, in view of results among the brethren, and the Lord says, "Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest". I should think we have got a principle in what the Lord says here, that would regulate us as to our service in view of the maintenance of quality. If we commit ourselves to too much, and too far ahead, well, how do we know that we shall be sustained in it?
A.E.M. Have the brethren got a part in this matter?
S.McC. They have. Both the ministers, and those ministered to enter into the matter, I think, as to what we are committed to, and what is taken on, I am sure it is important. In moving around in different parts, brethren have said in regard to this matter, Well, if we do not go that far ahead, we will not get some of the more prominent brothers. Well, I have said to them to do without them at the moment, I am not seeking to detract from those that are serving in a distinctive way, but if servants are
{65}
booked up so far ahead, the Lord may be indicating to us that there is someone nearer by, someone near at hand, like the little boy in @John 6. The Lord knew what He would do.
M.P.S. Might I ask which way round it should be approached by us? Do we arrange a meeting, and desire to find a brother to serve, or is the exercise to have a particular brother among us, and then arrange a meeting?
S.McC. Well, the desire comes up with the brethren to have a gathering of the saints to make way for the truth, and to promote the idea of fellowship. That would be a basic idea; then the great thing would be as to what the Lord has in mind, what is needed. Therefore the brethren would be cast upon the Lord, and upon the Spirit too, as to direction for who may be available, and whom the Lord would send. It is not just a person who has got a desire to come, but a person that the Lord would send. And I would think that there would be a converging in the exercises of the brethren, and in the commission of the Lord, if that were present.
A.C.S.P. When Mr. Taylor raised this matter at Bristol some years ago, did he not draw a big distinction between the need to arrange a meeting, possibly because a hall had to be booked, and the need to ask a servant too far ahead?
S.McC. Therefore there would be a difference in regard to three-day meetings of this character, where a hall has to be arranged for, and many arrangements have to be made in regard to the comfort and accommodation of the brethren. Wisdom would work out in taking all that into account. But booking up for nine months, or twelve months for *fellowship meetings* is more than I can understand. Personally, I am not at all free to do it. I think it engenders and develops a competitive spirit among the brethren, as to whom they will have, and whom they will get,
{66}
instead of being more subject to the Lord, as to whom *He would send*.
A.H. Would what you are remarking have its bearing on engagements to preach the gospel?
S.McC. I should think the brethren, in considering over these matters, would have wisdom. I do not think that any of the services should be tied up in such a way that we are not ready to make room for whom the Lord may send at any time. We may have things so tied up in engagements, and the Lord may send a servant, and he may have to sit by. Although he is commissioned to go to that locality, he may have to sit by because of an arrangement that has been made long before.
G.R.C. Is not that a matter that we might think about -- flexibility? If arrangements are made, they should be truly held as provisional, and subject to the Lord's will, so that on both sides there is a readiness to release the matter.
S.McC. I think that is right. There should be the element of flexibility in making room for others so that if a person has been asked to serve, and another comes along, and has gift or ability, surely we would make room for such if it was felt that he was sent by the Lord.
G.R.C. I was thinking of Paul's outlook in @Romans 15, he has got a long programme before him, he says, "Now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints", but prior to that he says that he hopes to come to Rome on his way to Spain. So that he has got a long programme before him, but we do not read that he ever got to Spain, he was evidently subject to the Lord's will, and flexible. I wondered if it is allowable to have a programme in that sense, subject to God's will, that is truly flexible.
S.McC. In the sense in which Paul alludes to it. And in the sense in which you are coming to America, the brethren are looking forward to that, and meetings
{67}
have been arranged for; we are not referring to that. But what Paul is alluding to there is that he has certain places in mind, but as far as we can see, there was no definite tying up of meetings in that arrangement. It is just as we might say, Well, we have Germany, or France in mind to visit. It is flexible as to what the Lord has in mind, do you not think?
G.R.C. Yes, I think if that was held it would help us a lot, because sometimes when a commitment is made provisionally by a brother, the brethren do not like it much if he says later that he does not feel free to carry it out.
S.McC. We must be subject to the Lord's commission, to the Lord's sending. If indication comes about that the Lord has not sent you, well, we are to take account of that, but a servant would not be careless as to what he is committed to. He would not go back on it unless serious circumstances warranted it. Paul speaks in 1 Thessalonians of desiring to come to them but Satan hindered them. That would be another matter.
R.T.H. It says in @Mark 3: 14, "And he appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them ...".
P.L. What about the three Lord's days at Thessalonica? Should not liberty be afforded for a brother to continue for that period if he finds confirmation as he proceeds? Sometimes a brother is invited immediately afterwards, making it impossible to carry out that period.
S.McC. It is important that we should make room for Paul's principle in that way; it was his custom apparently, and we would be governed, in some measure, by Paul's custom in that sense.
A.H. You raised a very interesting matter a moment ago, as to being *sent*. We answer pretty much to "Come and he comes". But the man said to another "Go and he goes". Do you think we are
{68}
sufficiently sensitive as to this matter of that word?
S.McC. I think we should be more sensitive as to being sent, that we do not have to wait on an invitation to go to a place. We may get invitations from places, and they are to be valued in that sense, but then, it may not be the Lord's mind at all to send you to that place. The Lord may send you to a place where you have not got an invitation. Why would you hold back from that? We are to be governed by commission in that sense.
C.M.M. Could you say a little more about the little boy here? There seem to be peculiar difficulties in the British Isles, and I have wondered whether, where the saints discern quality developing, room should not be made for younger men?
S.McC. I think it is important that we should recognise what is amongst us, and what the Lord is doing. We have the Spirit, and the Lord has given us wisdom, and we should recognise gift wherever it appears, whatever a person's years may be. If there are definite indications of gift there, let us commit ourselves to it, and make room for it.
W.McK. In the passage quoted from @Romans 15. Paul says "that my ministry which I have for *Jerusalem*" -- he had a sense of a commission, but would you say he had something from the Lord for that place? Should not the servants seek to have something like that, too, in their movements?
S.McC. Just so, but keeping in mind the day of brokenness in which we are, because it is important that we should not take too high ground. It is important that we should see the unofficial character of things that we are in, and not build up a reputation along human and natural lines. The Lord would sober us here, when He says, verse 38, "I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured: others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours". Well, where does that leave us? The
{69}
Lord is not making too much of us in this matter, and we have to keep that in mind. Especially that the quality should be maintained in the reaping, and gathering fruit unto life eternal; we must see that things do not degenerate, or become attenuated.
H.W. Things did not degenerate with Philip, either in desert conditions, or at Azotus?
S.McC. No, they did not. One has been thinking a little of late in regard to doing what one's hand finds to do, because I suppose that is the principle on which most of us go. We cannot speak much about anything beyond that, and this question comes up as to whether we are sufficiently in touch with the Spirit, in communion with the Spirit. The Spirit brought all the gifts with Him at Pentecost, and they have come from an ascended Christ, but they are all under the hand of the Spirit, and the Spirit has sovereignty in His distributions in that relation. If therefore we were more in communion with Him, then perhaps we might get indications as to where we should go that we have not thought of before.
P.L. "And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul", @Acts 13: 2.
S.McC. Showing how important it is to recognise the Spirit in authority in the matter of distributions, and in the work that has to be done.
F.G.S. Does Haggai set out the matter? He speaks of himself as "Jehovah's messenger, in Jehovah's message".
S.McC. It is important that we should be that. We are not concerned about our reputations or the amount of meetings that we take, or whether we take three-day meetings or not, because after all, the platform here does not make the man. The man is the man; he is what he is by being divinely made. We want to see that, and therefore be concerned as to the quality, I remember, in another
{70}
part of the world, a sister was introduced to a brother years ago, and she did not recognise him, and he said, 'Don't you know me? I write in the monthly magazines!' Well, that is very humbling if we depend on the monthly magazines, with due respect to the magazines which we value and our brothers¬ services in them, it is very poor. We are to be concerned as to this quality that life eternal brings in.
J.S.E. Is there some significance in pursuance of that, in that Andrew figures more largely in John, where there is nothing official, than he does where things are official?
S.McC. That is very interesting. Say something more about it.
J.S.E. It was he who introduced the little boy, and the Lord seemed to take the matter on, and, as Mr. Taylor pointed out many years ago, it is not said in that chapter that He made use of the disciples in the distribution, He did it Himself. There are three actual incidents in the gospel, where Andrew shines in an unofficial way, and something is secured positively for the pleasure of Christ through him.
S.McC. Mr. Taylor made a remark years ago which one closely observed at the time, and it affected one: he referred to the fact that we should be dexterous enough to avoid what is official. We should employ dexterity in avoiding what is official, lest we should build up a reputation that may some day crash.
A.P.C.L. Would verse 34 preface what you have been saying, "My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work"?
S.McC. Very good, I was going to refer to that earlier, and I am glad you have brought it in, because, where were they? Look at the important work that was going on and was being done. Where were they? They were in the city about loaves. Well, that was a
{71}
low level to be on, and they wonder about the Lord when they come back, and He says, "I have food to eat which ye do not know", and then "my food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work". I think we want to be affected by that and see how our constitutions are built up, and what we are feeding on, in the matters of ministry.
J.T.Jr. Would that verse, verse 34, stress the point that has been before us? "That I should do the will of him that has *sent* me". I think there is more in the thought of being sent than there is in the thought of invitation.
S.McC. I think so too myself. One is more concerned about the matter of being sent than the number of invitations that are received. Because it casts you back on the Lord, and upon the Spirit, as to what the Lord has in mind, in regard to ministry and service among the saints.
A.P.C.L. So that service is never regarded as an object in itself. In @Ephesians 4 it is "until we all arrive".
S.McC. That is very important; it is not an object in itself. If ministry becomes an object in itself, it will exalt the servant and the result is that there will be disaster -- disaster among the saints, and disaster with the servant.
R.W.S. So while it is useful to know who is serving in different parts of the world, and we have a few of the meetings listed, is there not a danger that that might bring in the thought of the clergy and the laity?
S.McC. We want to be dexterous, as we have referred to it, in avoiding what is official, and in what would have anything for the flesh to make a little of, in ourselves. If we know the plague of our own hearts, we know the constant need day by day for the water aspect of the death of Christ. And the
{72}
circumcision, too, it is complete death to the flesh, and all that marks it, as the death of Christ is applied in the power of the Spirit. That is a daily matter.
E.C.M. Would @1 Corinthians 3: 7 and 8 bear on this. Paul says, "So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase. But the planter and the waterer are one"?
S.McC. The references in Corinthians to the planter and the waterer are very interesting, and the same here with the sower and the reaper. We might want to be planters, but that is a matter of divine commission. I may have to be content with watering; Apollos was content with watering, he was quite prepared to water what Paul planted, showing the wonderful unity in the ministry. So it says "that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together". An occasion like this thus provides what is pleasing to heaven, in that the saints, and those that serve among them, are seen together in an unjealous way, helping one another; because that is the idea of these meetings, as we have them now in the absence of the distinctive leadership such as we so greatly enjoyed in the years that are past. It is a time, at the present, of helping one another and of seeing what the Lord has in mind.
J.W.D. Are your remarks in the way of what is suggestive, or is it authoritative? Do you expect the local assemblies of this country and the Lord's servants to follow your remarks authoritatively about invitations and as to being sent as against being invited?
S.McC. Well now, supposing I were to ask you that question, what would you say?
J.W.D. I would say that we would help them authoritatively.
S.McC. Any remarks that I make are subject to the judgment of the brethren, "Do ye judge what I say", @1 Corinthians 10: 15.
{73}
J.W.D. But where everything is on a different order, and practised differently, and a kind of 'Oh well, that is alright, but we have done it for so many years, and our meetings are characteristically marked by that'. Well, what about a change?
S.McC. I think we have to allow for wisdom in the saints, and judgment among the saints. In the light of the priesthood in Numbers, we are to discern what is ministered, and to take account of what is ministered, and as to whether the Lord is in it or not. That is all I would say.
A.H. Is not John specially selected by the Spirit to bring forward this very matter you are stressing, inasmuch as he is completely free from what is official himself, and a vessel to be used by the Spirit to stress this feature of the truth?
S.McC. Just so. Therefore we should be concerned as to whether in what we do, and the service that we carry on in doing what our hand finds to do, we are near to the Lord, as to whether we know what it is to be near to Him in that sense, as John was, bearing in mind his uniqueness and the special place John had.
R.W. Is this matter of mutuality seen in the way Barnabas sought out Saul?
S.McC. Yes, it is. Mr. Taylor referred to him many years ago, saying he was the unjealous introducer of his more gifted brother Paul. How heaven is pleased with unity amongst those that serve, that they say the same things, and that they have too, the same feelings in their heart. Paul said to the Corinthians, as to Titus, Timothy and himself, "Have we not walked in the same spirit? Have we not in the same steps?" @2 Corinthians 12: 18. The enemy could not get the wedge in, because they were not only united in what they were saying, but they were united in the spirit; they were united inwardly in the service.
{74}
-- .J. Is this matter of being sent characteristic of John's gospel? We also have the word in @Isaiah 6, "Whom shall I send?" And then, after some exercise, Isaiah says, "Here am I; send me".
S.McC. Well, in that sense we should all be available; that is, it brings up the matter as to whether we are available. I might like to go to a nice place, where the weather was nice, and the like. But Isaiah was not sent to a nice place, nor was he given a very pleasant ministry, at the time. He had to do with a people that were affected by the government of God in their blindness, and that was no easy service. So that we need to be available in that sense.
W.S.S. Paul was very simple and unofficial when he said, "Let us return now and visit the brethren ... and see how they are getting on", @Acts 15: 36.
S.McC. I think we have to see the need at the present time for the unofficial side, yet moving under the Lord's hand with a sense of a commission, for gift involves having a commission and how can gift serve without a sense of commission? If there is no sense of commission, how can you serve rightly in the sense in which we are referring to it?
P.L. And is not the commission bound up with vision, as with Moses, Isaiah and others?
S.McC. Yes. So that in the final chapter that we read, the Lord brings this matter up with the twelve; that is, he is testing the unity that is there. He does not speak directly to Peter, He says, verse 67, "Jesus therefore said to the twelve". We might say, Oh well, we cannot challenge the ministers, we cannot challenge the twelve. Why not? The Lord says to the twelve, "Will ye?" the emphatic *ye*, these persons, divinely selected, divinely made, as the eleven were, "Will *ye* also go away? Simon Peter answered him", but he did not say, Where shall we go? He says "to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal". It shows how the quality had risen above
{75}
everything in Peter's soul, risen above reputation and everything else. "Thou hast words of life eternal; and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God". That was something that Peter had reached in his soul. It was not a revelation, it was something that he had reached on the experimental side in his soul.
A.P.C.L. So he is referred to as Simon Peter?
S.McC. What do you make of that?
A.P.C.L. I thought it was the man that you have been speaking about, not only from the divine side, but from the side of what he was as Simon, and brought into things.
S.McC. Exactly. The linking of Simon with the name Peter would bear that out; it is important to see that. Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal". He had arrived at something in his soul in that condition which the name "Simon Peter" suggests.
A.J.G. Do you think that the fact that he says "we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God" shows that he recognised the necessity for moral suitability to be found with those who minister?
S.McC. You feel it is very important that in dealing with the holy things of truth, and the holy things of God, that there should be moral suitability and consistency in those who set them forth. So that the Lord goes on, verse 70, "Jesus answered them". It is a remarkable answer that He gives. He does not say, Well, that is a good word, Peter. He says, "Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil. Now he spoke of Judas the son of Simon, Iscariote, for he it was who should deliver him up, being one of the twelve". I think that word should come home to all our hearts, that evil was so near, so near in the circle in which love was operating, in this remarkable way, and that the Lord should name
{76}
him so specifically and definitely, "and of you one is a devil". That is the Lord's word.
P.C. Would Peter's reference to the Lord as "the holy one of God" link with verse 39 of chapter 5, where the Lord speaks of the Scriptures as "they it is which bear witness concerning me"? Does everything culminate in the Person?
S.McC. That is helpful. It shows that the whole scope of the testimony bears on Christ, and this chapter is a question of food, and how persons are constitutionally and what they are built up in relation to. The food is to build us up constitutionally and the answer is in Peter, and the others with him, Judas excepted; a right constitution comes out in what Peter confesses.
{77}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (4)
@John 10: 7 - 18, 27 - 30; @John 11: 1 - 6, 32 - 44; @John 12: 1 - 8
S.McC. These passages that we have read bring on to our view the thought of unity as seen in the one flock, and then in the circumstances at Bethany we have the thought of the family, figuratively setting out, as it does for us, the family of God. And it is in chapter 11, verse 51, that we get John's comment on the prophecy of the high priest, that year, "that Jesus was going to die for the nation; and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad", verse 51. The thought of the children of God brings before us the thought of the family, and, as the brethren would know, John does not give us formally, sonship in the saints in his ministry; he generally deals with the thought of the family of God from the standpoint of the children. It helps us therefore to see that while the sheep and the one flock bring in the idea of what is collective, touching what we have in Paul's ministry in relation to the thought of the body, the family side brings out individuality. It brings before us persons, but as @John 12 shows, after the experience of chapter 11 is worked out, they are bound together in unity in the knowledge of what has been wrought, and in the appreciation of Him who wrought it, the Lord Jesus Christ. I thought we might get help in regard to these two thoughts. They are well-known chapters, and the brethren may often have considered them, but perhaps the Spirit may help us afresh at this time in regard to what comes out here, in the way that love is made way for, in this section.
{78}
A.J.G. Would you say what is the distinctive thought connected with the flock?
S.McC. It brings up an interesting point, in relation to the sheep. It is not a question of how sheep are born, how they come into existence, but, as we know in @John 10, it is a question of what the sheep are, and the features that mark the sheep that are there that the Lord as the Shepherd takes account of. I thought the flock would link with the saints from that viewpoint in the Colossian letter. Both the Colossian and Ephesian letters would involve what we have in these two sections in regard to the sheep and the family, would you think?
A.J.G. Perhaps you would open that out a little more.
S.McC. Well, the great thought of "leading out", and "putting forth" is prominent in the service of the shepherd, and Colossians views the Lord in His influence upon the saints in relation to what is outside of Judaism, for Judaism adds nothing to the position in Colossians. This section refers to the Lord as leading out, putting forth; His influence is seen in that direction.
G.R.C. Have you in mind that the word "they follow me, and I give them life eternal", would involve following Him over Jordan, according to Colossians?
S.McC. I would think so. In verse 10 we have, "I am come that they might have life, and might have it abundantly". Life in that sense is linked with the position over Jordan, the faith state in the saints, as viewed in Colossians, laying hold of it. So that the subject of life, entering into all these passages is very important, and shows that the unity is an organic unity. It is not only unity in the truth, as we considered earlier, which is very important, but unity in life. That is, the life is the same wherever you view it.
{79}
J.S.E. Is there any significance in the fact that the Lord seems to present this side of the teaching to His enemies?
S.McC. I think there is. But would you say something more on what you are thinking of.
J.S.E. Just that He uses this figure of the sheep, on the one hand; it was that which was within the compass of their understanding, but it was to show that they were outside the range of enjoying its operations.
S.McC. So that oftentimes, where the truth comes out in the presence of opposition, there are special touches which we might not have got otherwise. I think that is the setting of @John 10. Life abundantly is exclusive to this dispensation. That is, no other family has this touch of life that the sheep of Christ have. The flock, the assembly viewed in that sense, comes into it now.
J.S.E. Has there been over the years, what we might call a spiritual build-up in the truth, coming to light in the presence of enemies, but the enemies not coming into it?
S.McC. So that the line of demarcation becomes more and more distinct, between the opposition to the Lord and His sheep, and what would nominally occupy a position, but not be according to the divine order.
P.H.H. Does the voice become of particular importance in that setting?
S.McC. I think it does. Much is made of the voice in this chapter. And the reference in verse 3 that we did not read, to the porter, is very important in that relation. Who is the porter opening to? The porter is not opening to the thieves and the robbers; the porter is opening to Christ, making way for Christ, the true Shepherd.
J.G.M. Who is the porter?
S.McC. The Holy Spirit would be in mind in the
{80}
figure of the porter; He opened the way for Christ. As the Lord was baptised, and the heaven was opened, the porter made way for Him. The Holy Spirit was there, and Christ was sealed by the Father, as He entered upon His public service in ministry.
P.H.H. Would the question of the voice stand over against the persuasive speech, and similar things, in the Colossian epistle? It says here that the sheep know his voice, but they know not the voice of strangers.
S.McC. What you refer to is very interesting, because one of the things that enters into the mystery of iniquity, or the mystery of lawlessness and its operating, is speech. Speech has a peculiar place, for God said, you will remember, in Exodus, "Who made man's mouth?" It is peculiarly one of the greatest and finest organs that God has made in man and the enemy has entrenched upon that, just as he has entrenched upon the expanse. He has come into that matter of man's mouth, especially in view of antichristian principles being promoted, that would make way for a rival to Christ.
P.H.H. So what is connected with the voice is leadership. It says, "When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice".
S.McC. We are all tested as to whether we know the voice in that way; the characteristic of the sheep is that it knows the voice. So that we can measure ourselves, for John gives us measuring lines by which we can arrive at where we are in regard to the Lord and in regard to the truth, and this is one of the measuring lines as to whether we are amongst the sheep of Christ, and hear His voice.
A.H. Do you distinguish therefore between His words, and His voice? We have His voice referred to in chapter 5. I wondered whether you had in
{81}
mind that the voice really covered the whole range of the truth.
S.McC. The voice peculiarly brings out the personality of Christ, in certain relations. We get the voice of the Bridegroom, the voice of the Son of God, the voice of the Shepherd, in this gospel. Why is John making so much of the voice, his ministry bearing on current conditions in the last days?
L.G.B. Would the word in @Revelation 1 bear on it? "I turned back to see the voice".
S.McC. That is why one was referring to personality, as linked with the voice. John turned to see the voice, and what he saw was the Lord Jesus. Personality is peculiarly linked with the voice.
Ques. Might the Shepherd's voice be heard in these meetings?
S.McC. We sincerely hope it is. We trust it is not the voice of the wolf, or the voice of the thief. We trust that we hear the Shepherd's voice, in gatherings such as these.
E.C.L. Would you connect what is in the body of the saints with the thought of what is in the flock, and how the Lord's voice in the truth is recognised? Is not that sometimes more reliable than one speaking here or one speaking there?
S.McC. So that there is a great value in seeing, in that sense, what there is in the body of the saints. It has often been pointed out, and often been noticed, that one of the distinctive things that characterised J.T.¬s service was the room that was made for what there was in the body of the saints.
E.C.L. Does not Paul speak of really protecting that, by way of oversight? The Holy Spirit is seeing to it that that is protected by way of oversight, so that the wolf does not get in.
S.McC. Just so. There is a certain safeguard in what there is in the body of the saints by the Spirit, although, of course, leadership is always required.
{82}
J.McK. Would the voice connect with the Lord passing on? We have, at the end of chapter 8, that He was passing on, and it says in the beginning of chapter 9, "as he passed on". Would this voice be a kind of delineation of that passing on, and indicate where the Lord is in the matter? And as @Psalm 78 speaks of His leading -- "He brought them to his holy border".
S.McC. So that if we do not recognise the voice we may be left behind; we are not among the sheep of Christ characteristically in that way. It is important to see that this section is full of movement. Here we have the Lord coming in, and going out, and putting forth; and then in the next section, with the family, it is full of movement.
C.H. Would the light of the Son of God, which is in the end of the previous chapter, be carried forward into this chapter? Is the Shepherd the Son of God? He is introducing us into that realm where the Son of God is to be supreme.
S.McC. That is right. And the presentation of the Shepherd and the flock is to draw out feelings, and to bring in the richness and refinement that are linked with the development of feelings in the assembly. Surely there is much room for that, and the enjoyment of life more abundantly would help in that relation.
W.S.S. Does the Lord come first of all into the Jewish fold, and then, calling His own sheep, He leads them out of that, with a view to the formation of the flock?
S.McC. Yes, that is what is in mind.
W.S.S. By application, have we not all got to get out of what is Jewish, to be in the flock?
S.McC. So that John makes a good deal of Jewish opposition; indeed the world, as it is presented in John's gospel, is largely characterised by what is Jewish. I suppose the Jewish element is the most
{83}
damaging element that John the apostle brings on to our view.
J.McK. Would the several occasions when the emphatic 'I' is used in this section bring into mind who the Person is? I was thinking of the way it occurs in the earlier chapter: "Before Abraham was, *I* am". Does it bring us to the inscrutability of this divine Person, and so involves mystery in the matter of shepherding?
S.McC. I think so; and along with the Person of Christ, in that way, the Father comes in, as in the latter portion of the chapter. The Lord brings the Father in, saying, "My Father who has given them to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father. I and the Father are one". We have mystery linked with the knowledge of these two wondrous Persons, in relation to the sheep, and the matter of security, life eternal, and not perishing.
A.H. The matter of suffering is brought into this again, but is it of note that the Father loves Him because of that?
S.McC. Yes, the Lord laying down His life furnishes the Father with the motive for loving Him, as we have often heard, "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again".
P.H.H. Referring to this matter of the Lord's Person, when He says "*I* am the door", and when He says "*I* am the living bread", and other expressions, are we to understand that behind those specific things, there is the inscrutability of His Person? "*I* am the door" would mean what He is, I suppose, but "before Abraham was, *I* am" would be the greatness and deity of His Person, would it not?
S.McC. Yes. John all the way through stresses the Person of Christ. The very opening verse of his gospel draws attention to that, and all the way
{84}
through the greatness of the Person who is before us in the mediatorial position constantly comes on to our view.
P.H.H. The entering in, as the Lord says, is "by me"; would that mean that presently there will open up to us the greatness of the Lord's person, as shining upon everything in this gospel of John?
S.McC. I think so. In that sense there is a link with Colossians, where the Person of Christ is projected on to our view in a very special way. It is very interesting that in Colossians there is only one allusion to the Spirit, and that reference is to the saints, and their "love in the Spirit". From there on we get the Person of Christ enlarged upon in the ministry of Paul to the Colossians.
J.T.Jr. How do you think we get hold of the truth of the door now?
S.McC. I think we arrive at it by response to light as it is presented. As light is presented to us, in regard to the truth and divine thoughts, we come into the gain of what Christ is as the door, and we move in relation to it. Perhaps you would say something as to it?
J.T.Jr. In verse 7. He says, "Verily, verily", that is Christ, "I say to you". That is, He is emphasising this point of the door, "*I* am the door of the sheep". So you would have to see what that would mean now; the door must mean the way into things.
S.McC. It is important in that light to see the principle that stands in the scriptures from Genesis to Revelation, namely, that you only understand the truth rightly when you move into the circumstances to which the truth applies. Therefore, if light comes into your soul as to the truth of God, you cannot work that out in circumstances that are not in keeping with it; you have to move out of them.
J.McK. Would the idea of hearing the Lord's
{85}
voice be somewhat instinctive, but would coming to the matter of the door involve understanding and movement?
S.McC. It does. The door is the way in. It is not that the truth is the door; the Lord is saying that *He* is the door.
E.E.H. Would you say the man in chapter 9 would be one who would be led into the flock by the door?
S.McC. I think he finds the door.
A.W.G.T. Does not that confirm what you said, that we have to be in the circumstances in order to get the gain of the truth? The man in chapter 9 came into the circumstances which enabled him to find the door.
S.McC. The Lord heard he was cast out, and He found him, and presents Himself as the door. He presents the light of another world to him, in His own Person, as the Son of God. But I should like to hear something more, Mr. T., of what is in your mind in regard to the door.
J.T.Jr. The Lord further says, in verse 9 again, "I am the door: if any one enter in by *me*", so I would think the point would be how we come into things now. It must be by this means, "by me", He says. But then we have to see how that would be, for instance, in anyone coming in amongst us, as we say.
S.McC. Do not you think it is linked with the assembly at the present time, in the thought of the one flock, and the one Shepherd? The Lord is presented as the door, but the Lord is not here corporeally now, so that there would be some answer to the thought in what is here in relation to the Spirit.
J.T.Jr. So then, the whole matter would be under the Lord in any case. Someone coming in amongst us, it would be a question of the Lord as over it.
S.McC. Just so.
{86}
J.H. Is that seen worked out practically with Ananias in connection with Saul of Tarsus?
S.McC. Well, it is. The Lord is over the whole matter in @Acts 9; but then we find that under His hand are certain things here below for the Lord says, "Rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do". That is how Saul of Tarsus is coming into things; the Lord is in control and charge of the whole matter, but He is calling attention to what is here.
M.A.W. Later on in the Acts, in regard of Saul being brought to the apostles, it says "Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how that he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him". I was thinking of the reference to the Lord as the door, and the Lord being over all.
J.T.Jr. So would there be two points there? There was what was directly with the Lord, and then what was directly with Ananias, linking with your point of the assembly.
S.McC. I think it is very helpful to see how this is working out in that sense, because, as we were taught years ago in connection with persons coming into things or finding their way into things amongst us, there is no such thought of reception. There is no idea of an administrative act in receiving them; you are really recognising what is there, that is under the hand of the Lord, and what is represented in Ananias would be the recognition of what is happening in the washing of the robes.
C.H. I would like to ask Mr. T. if he not only thinks that we recognise the Lord's hand as over things, but that souls have had to do with the Lord for themselves in finding their way.
J.T.Jr. Quite so, they have had to do with the Lord. The Lord is the first consideration in the matter. He must be, He says, "I am the door".
{87}
C.H. Saul had had to do with the Lord, and the Lord had had to do with him, before he met Ananias.
J.T.Jr. That is really the point, I think, that connects here. The Lord says twice, "I am the door". Well, He had got the sheep in mind evidently as an area of things.
A.J.G. Would there be any connection, do you think, with what we have in @Hebrews 13? It seems to give the way out, and then the way in there. It says, "Therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach", and then it says, "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise continually to God". Do we get the idea there of being brought out, and then being introduced by Him into the sphere where the service of God proceeds?
S.McC. That is an interesting link, in that way, with what we have here. So that what we are now considering is important, how the Lord stands out in this matter, and how the sheep are viewed as having to do with the Lord in this way. It is a question of what is characteristic in the sheep, not exactly what is developed. There is no thought in this chapter of development; it is a question of what the sheep are basically and characteristically, and there is a cue in that for us, in regard to persons coming into the truth, whether it be initially, or in recovery.
A.P.C.L. Would the fact that the thought of sheep is used indicate the tenderness that would mark us in dealing with such persons? I am thinking of the way in which the Lord speaks of laying down His life for them. There is a tendency with sheep to go astray, and that kind of thing, but would that not tend to concern us that persons should find the right way and have to do with the Lord?
S.McC. Yes, the sheep in that sense develop the thought of care, they are the objects of care, I suppose,
{88}
however we have to keep clear that in John's gospel the sheep are not viewed as going astray; they are characteristically viewed as under the influence of the Shepherd, although subject to alien influence.
W.C. Are they not regarded as the Father's gift to Him? He says later, "My Father who has given them to me". Would not that be purpose?
S.McC. That reference is interesting, for it is a question of divine ownership. We have the wolf, or the false shepherd, and it is a question of disputing divine ownership, whereas the Lord is asserting divine ownership here. Therein lies our safety, because we are to understand this word 'perish', and the fact that the Lord gives the sheep life eternal, over against the perishing conditions.
A.J.G. Is that the result of the sheep characteristically hearing His voice, and following? Does it not result in their coming into life eternal?
S.McC. I think that is how the truth is set out here. It says, "they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand". We have to let that have full weight in our minds.
G.R.C. Would you say a word as to verse 14, and the kind of knowledge that the sheep have? We usually think of sheep, in the figure that is used, as not having much knowledge, but needing much care.
S.McC. I think the Lord is indicating, in this section what we have in the Colossian side of the truth, which opens up the thought of knowledge. The Colossian and Ephesian epistles open up the thought of knowledge, and develop it in a refined way, and the sheep are referred to, as the Lord says, "and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father". That would be the divine standard of knowledge that is before us in the economy, and the sheep come into that character
{89}
and kind of knowledge. The divine standard of knowledge would be in the assembly now.
P.L. "That ye may be filled with the full knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding", @Colossians 1: 9. Then we have "walking worthily of the Lord". Is that it?
S.McC. Just so. It is a knowledge that is not derived from the activity or the influence of the human mind, but a knowledge that is derived from being under the influence of Christ, which Colossians emphasises.
G.R.C. Would you say a word as to the level of it, "as the Father knows me and I know the Father"?
S.McC. I thought that that was the divine standard of knowledge that we are brought into, as having part in the mystery, just as we have it, in another relation in @1 Corinthians 13 the great chapter of love, "Then I shall know according as I also have been known". It is the divine standard of knowledge that we shall arrive at the judgment-seat of Christ in the perfected state. But the sheep are brought on to this standard of knowledge in their links with Christ now. What would you say yourself about it?
G.R.C. I cannot say much about it to add to what you have said; it seems so remarkable, "as the Father knows me and I know the Father". He had the full and complete knowledge of the Father's will and pleasure, and the Father had a full and complete knowledge of Him.
S.McC. I think we are all tested as to this knowledge, and how much of it is apprehended by us, and enjoyed by us. Because it involves the intimate links that we have with divine Persons, especially the collective position being stressed, for this chapter stresses, or emphasises the collective position.
A.J.G. Does it flow out of being characteristically near to the Lord, and attentive to His voice, because
{90}
the flock normally is never far from the Shepherd, is it?
S.McC. No, it is not. That is why one is emphasising the thought of intimacy in regard of it. It is important that in these days, when there are those who mount up elsewhere, the thieves and the robbers, and when there is the character of the wolf around, that we should keep near to Christ, so as to come under His influence, and under the Father's influence too.
R.G.B. In @Colossians 2 you have the thought, of "being united together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the full knowledge of the mystery". That is over against the thought of persuasive speech, would that bear upon what we are considering?
S.McC. Yes, one has that section in mind, which makes a good deal of man's mind, and man's speech, as it appears there, and as Paul meets it and counteracts it by the presentation of the headship of Christ. We must abide in Christ. @Colossians 2 involves John's way of abiding in Christ. If we do not abide in Christ, hold fast the Head, we will come under the influence of men. Why is it that so many, sometimes, are affected wrongly? Because we are not abiding in Christ in that sense.
C.M.M. You spoke just now, of restoration. Would you be free to guide us as to what we should look for in one seeking to be again amongst us?
S.McC. Well, does not the Lord take up the matter of restoration in this book? He goes into things with Peter, and not once, nor twice, but three times. Peter seems to show almost a little irritation the third time, but the Lord emphasises that matters have to be gone into, in that sense, and things be fully bottomed, and fully judged. You would look for self-judgment in persons finding their way amongst us, I would say, and for indications that they have
{91}
been with God, and that they have been with the Lord thoroughly about matters.
T.J.G. Would you say that when Peter replies to the Lord's third enquiry, "Thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee", referring to the knowledge that the Lord had of himself, that there was there what was obvious by way of repentance and recovery seen in Peter. Is that right?
S.McC. Yes. Peter has to learn that he cannot generalise, and just say, Well the Lord knows all things, from the standpoint of omniscience. Well, the Lord does know all things, but then, it is a question of what comes concretely on to view in persons in their restoration.
J.H. Would it not be manifest that they knew His voice?
S.McC. You would look for that. That would be a characteristic in persons that are right in regard to the Lord, and in regard to the truth.
P.H.H. Does the matter of the shaving of the hair, as in @Leviticus 14, become an apparent evidence that the man is on the way to restoration?
S.McC. Yes, it is part of the cleansing operations. It is a stripping of all that which attaches to the man personally, in view of his coming into the realm from which he was put out.
J.S.E. At which part of the reading did you introduce restoration? I thought the word was 'reception' that you used. Did not you say that we have to bear in mind what we were taught some years ago that we have no justification to speak of receiving people? Is not that what you said?
S.McC. I did say that, but I also used the word 'restoration' just incidentally, in passing along, referring to what was alluded to in the door, and persons coming into things. It was just casually referred to.
W.C. Does restoration come in more in Luke?
{92}
The sheep here characteristically are immune, are they not, from these influences? They may be scattered, but in themselves they are preserved. First of all the Lord says they do not hear the voice of the stranger, those that went before Him, and then they follow Him.
S.McC. Yes, we want to see that, in John's gospel the sheep are what they are, there is no question of development with them. But then, certain principles are laid out in regard to the door, and the way in, that govern us in all matters.
R.W.S. Would it be diverting to bring in the prayer meeting, and the care meeting, and personal visiting in the light of Paul's word in @Acts 20 "to shepherd the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of his own"?
S.McC. I think what you are referring to now is important, because we want to see that the thought of the assembly is to weigh heavily with us in all matters; the one flock is John's way of referring to the assembly. And when it says, in @Matthew 18, "Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth", it is not exactly that two singly agree, it is the thought of the assembly that is weighing heavily in the mind of the Lord, as He says those words.
J.S.E. When you say not two singly, what did you just mean? Do you mean they do not get by themselves?
S.McC. Well, it is "two of you". The whole context is dealing with the augustness of the assembly, and the Lord contemplates what might come into the dispensation, and He says, "If two of you shall agree". What is weighing in the Lord's mind is the assembly -- "two of *you*".
A.J.G. Even though the expression of it is as small as that?
{93}
S.McC. Just so. But Dr. S., in regard to what you were saying, would you say more?
R.W.S. Well, shepherds and teachers come as one gift in @Ephesians 4. It may be the teaching by itself involves the platform, but would not involve the trials of being a shepherd.
S.McC. It is very important that we see how shepherd feelings, shepherd care and protection come into this chapter in contrast to those that serve for wages. We have had a good deal, of course, about service, and the like, in these meetings, and I think it is very important that we should not serve for wages. It is baneful to think of service carried on for *wages*. It may even be the actual expression of fellowship. What a poor level service would fall to if it was only on that level, instead of care and love for the sheep in an unselfish way.
M.L.J.M. Does Peter's first letter help us, when he says "exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly"?
S.McC. Yes, and it is interesting what is referred to in that relation; it is "shepherd the flock of God". We are never to let the consideration for persons, just as persons, to overshadow the thought of divine proprietary rights, divine ownership. We are to see that that has full place, it is "the flock of God".
J.T.Jr. And the shepherd is concerned that the sheep are not scattered; that is his main business.
S.McC. A very important business, too.
J.P.H. Paul says in @Acts 20: 33, "I have coveted the silver or gold or clothing of no one. Yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my wants, and to those who were with me". And he goes on to give this choice quotation of the Lord's own words "I have showed you all things, that thus labouring we ought to come in aid of the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said,
{94}
It is more blessed to give than to receive". Is that over against serving for wages?
S.McC. That is a very remarkable thing, how the Spirit of Christ in Paul comes out in @Acts 20, whether as the shepherd, or like the Hebrew bondman, there was the unselfish way in which he was among the brethren, serving, even as he says to the Corinthians "if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved". In fact, although he was local at Corinth for such a long time, yet he would not take anything of them in regard to levitical service lest he should give any ground for their boasting.
J.W.C. It says of Israel that he "served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep", @Hosea 12: 12.
S.McC. He is a type of the Lord in that way, in His service, how He served for the assembly. We are to be marked by that spirit, and it involves how we are in the local positions, because we have to bear in mind that leadership is essential, and the shepherd brings in the thought of leadership. The mutual side in the flock cannot be held exactly by itself, without the influence of the shepherd as has been said. Mutuality is not always safe, if it is brought forward, or set forward over against leadership.
F.D.W. So it says in @Acts 15, "leading men among the brethren".
S.McC. Yes, "*among* the brethren", not above the brethren.
P.H.H. Would you say a little more about the introduction of the Father in this chapter? The Lord brings it in in verse 15, and it seems to follow throughout the chapter. We understand, I believe, that in reading John's gospel, the Father was the thought which was very close to the Lord. He says also "My Father". Is He now transferring the flock, so to speak, on to a more family ground, in introducing the Father?
{95}
S.McC. I think so, and especially emphasising, as it were, the economy and how divine Persons are in the economy in relation to one another and in relation to the saints. You will notice that immediately He brings the Father in in this way in verses 29 and 30, it says, "The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him". That is, it draws out the peculiar activity of the enemy, just like the economy in the beginning of the Acts draws out the frontal assault of the enemy in @Acts 5 in Ananias and Sapphira.
P.H.H. Yes, I think that is a great help, I was thinking of something like that. We have perhaps the Spirit, in the porter, would you say, and then the economy, in a major way, in the Father and the Son, so that we are handed over to the best.
S.McC. That is it, and we should see the unselfish relations between divine Persons in this holy matter, the unjealous and unselfish relations in regard to the sheep. The Lord says that they are in His hand, in verse 28, but then He says in verse 29, "no one can seize out of the hand of my Father". We can see the remarkable way in which things are held in this circle of things.
W.S.S. Does verse 17 show how the Lord had the Father before Him in relation to the flock, what the flock would mean to the Father?
S.McC. It is all in that setting and environment that we have that.
W.S.S. Would it not link up with the burnt-offering, the Lord's devotedness in securing what would be for the pleasure of the Father eternally?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. John stresses the burnt-offering side, the voluntary side, of the Lord's laying down His life. Now we must come on to chapter 11. The Father is brought into chapter 11, in verse 41, in regard to the particular matter on hand. The Lord "lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I
{96}
thank thee that thou hast heard me; but I knew that thou always hearest me". The thought of the family here is very important, because there is a good deal of pressure among the brethren, and the pressure is intended to bring out the feeling side. The family side in @John 11 makes particular room for the development of feelings where there is pressure bearing in upon the family.
G.R.C. Did you say at the beginning that the family brings out individuality, in contrast to the flock, where we are all viewed alike?
S.McC. I thought that was the setting in which it is viewed here. It says "Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus", and also "He whom thou lovest is sick". It is a question of the Lord's links with each of the members of the family.
T.J.G. Would you say a word as to the two words used for love? In regard of Lazarus in verse 3 we have the love of friendship, and when it refers to the women, in verse 5 there is the settled condition idea, in love.
S.McC. Well, we have to make room for attractiveness in the family of God. There was the thought of attractiveness in Christ Himself, and the first word for love bears on that in regard to Lazarus. Why should we take issue with that? If there are those that draw out the love of friendship from Christ, we would delight in the thought of it.
J.McK. Were you thinking that the Lord would bring in something of the glory of the Father, in His operation at the grave?
S.McC. I thought the glory of God really involved that, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" What was the glory of God? In the wonderful way that the power of death was met, and life comes on to our view in one who is raised from the dead.
P.H.H. Does not that come in confirmatorily in
{97}
chapter 12, where the Lord is speaking to the Father, and the Father is answering? The Lord says, "Father, glorify thy name", and then the voice out of heaven says, "I both have glorified and will glorify it again". Is not that mentioned in relation to the Father specifically?
S.McC. Yes. Now in chapter 11, verse 41 follows immediately verse 40, that is, the Lord raises the issue as to the stone, the stone has to be taken away. Now we are to notice that in this setting here, because, when we come to the rapture, as we perhaps may have heard, there is no idea of taking the stone away. When the Lord descends Himself personally with the assembling shout, there is no suggestion or idea of the stone being taken away, the dead in Christ will be raised. But there is an issue involved here, and the Lord says "Take away the stone". It is not that He is going to do it. He could easily do it, but that is not the point. He is saying "Take away the stone", and Martha would hold Him up in relation to the stone. The point, I believe is, that all that is linked with that corrupt condition must be faced, but faced in the light of the glory of God, and the power of God that can cope with it, and deal with it. We do not want to keep the stone on the mouth of the sepulchre, if the Lord says "Take away the stone".
E.C.L. Would you be free to say something about the thought of the sisterhood that comes in chapter 11? Some prominence seems to be given to the idea of the sister.
S.McC. It is very interesting how the sisterhood comes in, and especially in regard to this matter of the stone. That is, it is not the Jews that the Lord is speaking to; the Jews are there, but the Lord says, in verse 39, "Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days there". It is as if Martha
{98}
would keep the stone there; she does not want the offensiveness of all that is hidden behind the stone to come out. But if the glory of God is to enter into this matter, and the power of God, the stone must be taken away, and the sisters are to understand that.
J.T.Jr. So she does not say any more after that. I was thinking it would show the way she was reached, "Jesus says to her". Is it not an affectionate reference -- "the sister of the dead"?
S.McC. It is, and an unusual reference, "Martha, the sister of the dead".
A.H. Over against that statement, would you say a word as to verse 2, where the Spirit of God seems to emphasise that Lazarus was Mary's brother?
S.McC. It shows how personality stands out in that way, in Mary. The Spirit of God through John projects her on to our view before the matter of death is dealt with. In chapter 11: 2 John says "it was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick". But when we come to verse 39 that was referred to, it is "Martha, the sister of the dead". A very interesting link, to see how both of them are linked with Lazarus in the different ways in which he is referred to.
T.J.G. Would you say how you are connecting in your mind this matter of the issues to be raised, the corruption, with the thought of the family?
S.McC. We do not like, perhaps, the offensive side to come fully out, but the Lord joins issue with the matter; He said, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" He did not say to her, 'Did I not say to thee that if the stone was rolled away thou shouldest see the glory of God?' He said, "Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" The issue had to be met in Martha's own soul, just as the issue has to
{99}
be met in every one of our souls in similar circumstances.
Ques. Is that issue met in the fact that *they* rolled away the stone? While Martha was concerned about the corruption, *they* rolled away the stone?
S.McC. It is very interesting to see that the moment the Lord meets the issue in Martha's soul, and Martha seems to get help, it says "*they* took *therefore*", notice that adverb 'therefore', it does not just say 'they took the stone away', the adverb 'therefore' reflects on verse 40, "Did I not say to thee that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" Then it says, "They took therefore the stone away". Then the Lord lifts up His eyes on high; it is not now the sepulchre, not now what is behind that stone, but He lifts up His eyes on high and says, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me". There is moral order in the way the circumstances are related here.
A.H. Is not the Lord Jesus declared to be the Son of God by this matter, and does His glory shine out as well?
S.McC. Just so. You are alluding to @Romans 1, "marked out Son of God ... by resurrection of the dead"?
A.H. Yes, and the transfer of the whole family on to another ground.
S.McC. Yes, off natural grounds on to spiritual grounds. That is a very important thing, because there is nothing more baneful, or nothing more hindering than natural links, and social links, if they come into the assembly. It hinders the glory of God shining out, as it were; whereas, we want to see the importance of these spiritual links in the family of God, with which the glory of God is linked.
W.S.S. Are those spiritual links established at the beginning of chapter 12?
S.McC. Well, they are; we see the power of spirituality there in a realm where Christ is
{100}
everything -- He is the dominating object. Lazarus is not the dominating object, nor Martha nor Mary; the Lord, the Son of God is the dominating object.
J.S.E. Does the expression "they therefore" suggest that there are persons who are following in the current of what Christ is after in the incident?
S.McC. I think so, there is a link in sequence, therefore, with what has preceded, and I believe that the allusion to the pure nard bears on all that has gone before. It suggests that motives are clear, there is nothing opaque, nothing mixed; the result in this scene of spirituality is pure nard, which Mary has.
W.McK. Would you say that as the result of facing the issue, and the operations of Christ in relation to it, that in this chapter we have the odour referred to? The stink had to be faced in the previous chapter, but now the scene is clear morally and we have the odour.
S.McC. Just so, "the house was filled with the odour of the ointment". How much that means in a realm like this! The pure nard is really what has been arrived at, it is what Mary is expressive of, and the odour fills the house.
A.H. Does this reference to pure nard support your thought as to quality?
S.McC. Exactly. These thoughts are running through, and the note indicates that it is a word difficult of interpretation, but most likely pure. It is a result that is arrived at; it is not only that Mary has it, but it is affecting the assembly as we speak of it, the house being filled with the odour.
W.F. Do you connect the pure nard with the reference in the end of @Ephesians 6: "Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption"?
S.McC. That is just how I was linking it, in speaking of what is arrived at. It is pure love, pure
{101}
motives, there is no corrupting element there, "all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption".
C.J.H.D. Does the fact that the word is difficult of interpretation connect in any way with the work of the Spirit as formed among the saints being in some way inscrutable?
S.McC. That is interesting, because we are in a realm of spirituality, and in relation to what is spiritual, we have the word: "but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one", @1 Corinthians 2: 15. You are always faced with the element of mystery in connection with spirituality, whether in the realm, or in persons.
A.W.G.T. Would what you say as to personality in the family be confirmed in the number of references to persons in the epistle to the Colossians, their names being given?
S.McC. Yes. It helps us to value one another in that sense. While, according to Luke, some shadow is cast upon Martha, yet according to John she fits into her place in the scene, and it helps us to value one another in the light of the family of God and its spiritual setting with us.
C.H. Do you mean that the family has arrived at spiritual unity together, especially in relation to Christ?
S.McC. That is what one had in mind. While the family brings out personality in individuals, the result arrived at is unity in a realm where Christ is supreme.
J.P.H. In connection with Martha, it just says in chapter 12, that she served.
S.McC. It is good to see her as she is in chapter 12. She is not cumbered, she has not got too much on hand that is irritating her spirit, she is not complaining about Mary, nor about Lazarus, she has got the Lord, the Son of God, fully now on her view, and she is
{102}
absorbed with Him, and she is serving in the liberty that belongs to the family in that light.
A.J.G. So that each one stands out in his own distinctiveness according to the work of God in him.
S.McC. It makes the family of God in that sense such an attractive matter, and we need to see it more in this light, and the value of one another. So that in this sense we would be very careful not to write one another down, nor to write one another off. The Lord is standing in relation to each and each is loved by Him.
A.P.C.L. Would we not also be careful, not to project what comes to light in Judas, the material matter, into such a setting and spoil it?
S.McC. That is very interesting. Judas shows that he is not a sheep of Christ; he shows that he has not got the instincts and feelings of the family of God. I mean, if you give things their proper room and place, they will expose themselves, and Judas exposes himself here.
M.H.T. Does Lazarus supply another link with Colossians, in the reference to being dead, and risen with Christ?
S.McC. He does, that is the setting that corresponds with Colossians, that the saints are viewed as risen with Him by faith of the working of God; they are risen with Christ in that sense.
{103}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (5)
@John 12: 20 - 33; @John 13: 21 - 32; @John 14: 15 - 28
S.McC. It was thought mainly to consider the section from @John 14 to 17, but it came into one's mind last night, that perhaps we should refer to these sections that we have read from chapters 12 and 13, and then, if the Lord should so will, perhaps @John 17 this afternoon. The section in John from chapter 13 to 17, that we come into now, is really the backbone of the subject we are considering in spiritual unity, and in suggesting these passages, the thoughts in mind are to see how we are bound up in the humanity of Christ, first of all, and then how we are bound up together in the affections of Christ. We have the humanity of Christ in regard to the grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying, and the bearing of much fruit, that is the new kind of humanity in which we are together bound up with Christ. Then in @John 13, one feels that there is a typical and hidden allusion to the place of the assembly. In view of the degeneration and corruption under the influence of which the assembly has come publicly, it is important that we should see how we are bound up together in the affections of Christ. The fact that the Lord says of John in chapter 21, "If I will that he abide until I come", is perhaps an indication to us as to certain features that appear in John that would greatly help us in regard to the assembly's position at the close of the dispensation. There is no doubt a hidden allusion to it typically, in John, as in the bosom, and on the breast of Jesus. Then we should see in chapter 14, how we are bound up together in the life of Christ, as the Lord says, "because I live ye also shall live"; then how we are
{104}
bound with divine Persons together in a wonderful realm of love and affection. "In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". The new position is in mind in @John 14, in the section that we have read, and particularly the assembly position is in mind. The new position is linked with the Lord going away and the Comforter coming, the Spirit being here; and not only the Spirit coming, but abiding with us, as it says, "he abides with you, and shall be in you". That is a great steadying touch in regard to whatever may come into the history of the dispensation, because, while the Father and the Son coming to the one that loves Christ is a conditional matter, the Spirit's abiding with us throughout the dispensation is not a conditional matter. It is His own prerogative act, and it goes right through the dispensation whatever might come in. I thought we might get help in considering these thoughts, especially beginning with how we are bound up in the new kind of humanity that is seen in Jesus, as having gone into death. Lazarus had the experience of going into death, and coming out of death, but he came back into flesh and blood conditions. What subsequently happened to him we do not know, we are not told. Scripture leaves the matter silent as to what occurred with Lazarus afterwards. But he had the experience of going into death and coming out of it through resurrection power, although he came back into flesh and blood conditions. But what we are now considering is different. The Lord, in going into death and coming out of death, did not come back into flesh and blood conditions; He came into a new condition, and in that new condition, this kind of humanity is seen, which stands over against all that is in the world. It is a kind of humanity that we have part in, and that we are bound up together with Him in. As we know, other epistles, like @Hebrews 2 and Ephesians,
{105}
develop the subject more, but we get the indication in @John 12 as to this new kind of humanity in which we are bound up together with Christ.
J.P.H. Is not what you are now saying, about chapter 12, the basis of all our privileges in the assembly? We are *of* Him.
S.McC. Yes, we extend it forward in that way, and take account of @Hebrews 2 and @Ephesians 5, where there is a link with what we have here, it bears on the service of God. But chapter 12, which might be referred to in a general way, in one sense, is the completing of the Lord's public service, and we are in the days of the completing of our service and testimony. We are in what we might call the days of our translation; just as the days of the Lord's receiving up came about, and were fulfilled, so we are in the days of our translation. This passage here is therefore very remarkable as bearing on the climax of the Lord's public service.
M.P.S. May I ask whether you have anything special in mind in using the word 'humanity'? We perhaps have been more used to the word 'manhood'.
S.McC. Well, humanity stresses condition. It is the kind of humanity that was seen in Jesus, the condition into which He came, in the days of His flesh. It was flesh and blood, but in resurrection, having gone into death and come out in resurrection, there is a new kind and condition of humanity, and we have part in that condition of humanity. We have no part in the other.
J.G.M. It says in @1 John 3: 2, "and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". Does that link with what you are speaking of?
S.McC. That alludes to the full thought involving our bodies of glory, and to the fact that we shall be like Christ in our bodies of glory, fully conformed
{106}
to Him. What we have here is the abstract character of His humanity that answers to the purpose and thought of God eternally.
W.C.P. Does the scripture "as he is, we also are in this world" have any bearing on what you are saying?
S.McC. John is referring in that passage to the peculiar place that we are in. He says first of all in the passage that Mr. M. quoted, @1 John 3: 1, "See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the children of God". And then he goes on to say "what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is". Then he says, "And every one that has this hope in him", that is in Christ, "purifies himself, even as he is pure". And then the reference that you make from chapter 4, "as he is, we also are in this world" bears on the unique character of Christianity, that even now, there is that in the assembly, in the saints, which corresponds with Christ -- "which thing is true in him and in you". John's ministry makes a good deal of that.
-- .M. Do we get both sides in @2 Corinthians 5: 16, "but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know him thus no longer. So if any one be in Christ, there is a new creation"?
S.McC. There are many scriptures that bear on the subject that is before us here, and in which there is a link with what we are considering, but the main thought that is in one's mind is that we should get the practical gain of our participating together in this kind of humanity, especially in view of the culmination of things in the dispensation.
J.T.Jr. Do you think that the last chapter of Luke's gospel would be that the Lord came in amongst them to help them in regard to this matter, that they would be of Him? I am referring to @Luke 24: 39,
{107}
where He says "It is I myself". And then, "Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having".
S.McC. So it is important that we should see that we are of Him in that sense, that the humanity that rightly characterises us, in which we have part, is a humanity unknown to the world. It is not the kind of humanity seen amongst the Greeks, nor the kind of humanity in the world, it is the kind of humanity that is linked with the position on the other side of death.
J.S.E. Is that why it necessitates One who is Himself divine to lay this out in such language that there is no mistaking the divine intent as to the saints? It is not left to what we may call an ordinary human minister. Jesus is saying these things Himself, and asserting the fulness of divine thoughts as to the saints being bound up with Him in the way you are indicating.
S.McC. I think it is important to see that, because there is no reference to sowing in this matter. Generally the scripture speaks of seed sown, but there is no reference here to the act of another in relation to this matter, it is the Lord's own act. "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone". It does not say it is sown in the ground, it *falls* into the ground and it dies, and it bears much fruit. Only could that be true of a divine Person in that sense, and the Lord took that way in order that we might have part in this new kind of humanity. We are of Him, the assembly is of Him and out of Him in that sense.
J.O.T.D. Is the practical effect of the apprehension of this truth in the Lord's words in the succeeding verse, verse 25, having in mind that we are to hate our life in this world to keep it to life eternal?
S.McC. That is it. We might go over the doctrine of it, and in the ministers that have gone before, how
{108}
ably the doctrine of it has been laid out. How much was made of this section in F.E.R.¬s and J.B.S.¬s ministry, and in the later ministry of Mr. Taylor. But one's concern is not the doctrine of it so much, important as that is, but our practically coming into the gain of it, so that we are in the assembly as we should be, accepting the way of the cross, accepting the way of death. It is death to all that marks the humanity around us, so that we should have part in this kind of humanity in the assembly.
J.T.Jr. Does not the Lord's supper therefore bring about for us, how we get to know Him, and that we are of Him? The Lord's supper had a great place in the recovery, no doubt the servants that were used found in the Lord's supper the confirmation themselves of what they had doctrinally.
S.McC. Do not you feel in that way, at the present time, that we are tested by the Lord's supper and how it affects us, because eating enters into it? And then the Lord's manifestation or disclosure of Himself to us in these conditions is all a test, do you not think, to spirituality with us?
C.H. Is that why the Spirit of God puts this presentation of the Lord's humanity over against the Greek?
S.McC. That is what I thought. We have to learn to reject utterly and entirely, in our minds and our souls, the kind of humanity that is all around us, especially the Greek character of humanity as it comes in here. That is the kind of humanity that the enemy has exploited, to make much of man's mind and man's reasoning in certain things.
C.H. You mean they represent the best intellectually?
S.McC. That is what I had in mind.
W.C. There is what is religious, too, is there not? The Greeks came up to worship in the feast.
S.McC. Just so.
{109}
J.T.Jr. The thought of death would be a puzzle to the Greeks, and of course the Lord's supper is the expression of death. It is really the experience of these things every first day of the week that is to help the saints about this new condition.
S.McC. So it is very remarkable that the Lord's supper has really become a test in Christendom. It has been set aside, and the enemy has been in that, because of what we are now referring to; therefore the importance of seeing the death of Christ in this relation. The Lord speaks of it as a matter of parabolic fact, in verse 24, "Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die", but then, it is not a matter of parabolic fact in verse 27, for the Lord comes to the actuality of it, and the literality of it, when He says, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour. Father, glorify thy name". Surely the Lord has in mind in saying "But on account of this", the assembly at the present time, and what has come in in result.
A.L.R.T. Would you connect this with the reference in @Hebrews 2, as to the Sanctifier and the sanctified being all of one?
S.McC. That is what we were referring to earlier, when we said that we get the intimation of it here in the Lord's word, but not the development or opening out of it. But as we go to the epistles, we get in @Hebrews 2, and in @Ephesians 5, that we are of Christ, and out of Christ; the assembly, in that sense, is of Him and out of Him. That needs to impress our minds more and more, because the issue as to trade unionism and associations has been very practical, and it involves this matter, as to the kind of humanity that we have part in in the assembly.
J.S.E. And on the negative side, have not these associations included in their curriculum, this feature of patronage of Jesus as in flesh, and has not that
{110}
become one of the subtle features of it? And do we not easily fall a prey to that kind of thing, if we do not, by the Spirit, lay hold of this greater matter that we are bound up with Christ in His humanity in its present setting?
S.McC. If we do not get the gain of that, disintegration is bound to come about with us, because separation from evil is always God's principle of unity. That is why we read the verse as to "I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me". That is, in this section, we are in the presence of the way of the cross, the way of death, death to the world, and the kind of humanity in it. In Philadelphia we have the complete acceptance of that, and the Lord is pleased with it.
M.A.W. Is that why the practical dealing with associations and what is evil leads to the family of God in @2 Corinthians 6, in the reference to sons and daughters according to God?
S.McC. That of course, does not go as far as what we are speaking of here, because it is a figure of speech, as you know, that is employed in that verse. It has to do with the moral side, mixed conditions, sons and daughters, and the Lord Almighty being Father to us. But it is on the way to what we have here.
C.M.M. Would you distinguish between the Luke aspect of the Supper and what is said in Corinthians? In Luke it is "my body which is given for you", and in Corinthians, "my body, which is for you". Does that involve this new order of humanity and remind us of it week by week?
S.McC. I think it is important to see that. It bears on what Mr. T. was saying in relation to the Lord's supper, that when the Lord says "which is for you", He has in mind our appropriation of that. "This is my body, which is for you" has in mind the
{111}
appropriation, on the part of the saints, of what is conveyed in that.
E.C.M. Is this illustrated in all Israel being assembled to David to Hebron, in @1 Chronicles 11, where they say, "We are thy bone and thy flesh"?
S.McC. That would be a typical suggestion of what we have here, that we are of Christ in that sense.
A.P.C.L. In verse 26 it says twice, "If any one serve me". It would not be possible to serve in that sense unless we understood what you are saying, would it?
S.McC. I think it is important to see how service comes in in that relation. It says "He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal. If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant". Well, I think the "where I am" involves just what we are saying. It is the Lord in relation to this new condition of humanity, and His servant is to be there, as refusing the principles of the world and serving Him and following Him.
P.H.H. The Lord seems to bring in His Father a good deal at this point. First of all "Him shall the Father honour", and then His prayer "Father, save me from this hour", and "Father, glorify thy name". Could we have a little help on the Lord bringing the Father into the matter?
S.McC. One's impression has been in these days, that in referring to the ministry that has gone before us, and that has particularly characterised the revival (and we are carrying on now in the light of it in all its distinctiveness), that the Lord is testing us as to where we are practically in regard to the truth conveyed in doctrine as recovered in the revival. The matter therefore of the assembly as of Christ and out of Christ, has a very important bearing on us practically, and then there is the Father's
{112}
name. We speak a good deal about the Father's name and the wonderful way in which the Father is made known, but entering into this setting, it has a practical bearing on our lives as accepting the way of the cross, the way of death.
E.J.B. So would this reference to the Lord's soul being troubled be a great lever to us to move practically on this line?
S.McC. I thought that. The reference to His soul brings in that it is not an academic matter with us. I would guard that expression, for I am not referring to the Lord, I am referring to ourselves, that with us it is not an academic matter; it is a feeling matter, as seen in the Lord, saying, "Now is my soul troubled".
A.J.G. Does not the Lord indicate that it was a costly matter to Him in order to bring in this new order of humanity in which we are to have part?
S.McC. And are we not to be affected by that, that it was a costly matter to Him?
E.J.M. Would you mind amplifying what you had in mind in referring to the assembly in verse 27 in connection with the expression "on account of this"?
S.McC. "But on account of this have I come to this hour. Father, glorify thy name". The Lord is thinking of what would be involved in the Father's name as it stands out in this way, and especially what is reached in the assembly in regard to it.
M.H.T. Would the references in @Leviticus 2 to the oblation of thy first-fruits, and in @Leviticus 23 to the new oblation, help us to understand what you are bringing out as to the humanity of Christ and our part with Him in that order of manhood?
S.McC. Are you linking the new oblation with what we have in @John 12?
M.H.T. Yes. In @Leviticus 23, it is what is brought out of our houses.
S.McC. You would not link that with @John 12, would you?
{113}
M.H.T. I only felt there was a link between the manhood of Christ as seen personally in chapter 2, and the new oblation. @Leviticus 23, which refers to Pentecost typically, as linking us with Him in that humanity.
S.McC. Well, now that you have brought it up, it is perhaps good to see the difference. It is not exactly that they are the same, because they are not. I mean, the new oblation is different from what we have here, because what we are speaking of in @John 12 is a *sinless* order of humanity. What you have in the new oblation is not a sinless order of humanity, for the leaven is there, and in @Acts 2 the leaven was there, but rendered inactive by the fire. There is no need for the fire in this kind of humanity that is out of Christ that we are referring to in @John 12.
J.S.E. It is all of itself.
S.McC. Just so. It is good to see the contrast, that what is referred to in @Leviticus 23 is the kind of humanity that bears on the scene of testimony, where persons are in mixed conditions, but in @John 12, and @Hebrews 2, and @Ephesians 5, it is not contemplating mixed conditions, but the pure, sinless conditions that we have part in as bound up with Christ in it. Is that clear? Do you go with that?
M.H.T. Yes, fully.
L.G.B. Is not this an incorruptible order of humanity?
S.McC. That is what was meant in using the other word -- 'sinless'.
G.R.C. Would you say a word as to why Philip's locality is mentioned, "who was of Bethsaida of Galilee", and why he tells Andrew, and they come and tell Jesus? I wondered how this truth bore on the testimonial setting.
S.McC. I think it bears in its testimonial setting in the sense that as in our souls we are in the apprehension
{114}
of being bound up with Christ in this kind of humanity, we reject entirely the features of the other kind of humanity, and that is seen in our practical walk and life before men. Instead of being men that depend on their mental ability, or men that depend on their natural resources, we have accepted the way of the cross, and the way of death, that leads into this new kind of humanity. What would you say yourself?
G.R.C. I was thinking that. The fact that Philip's locality is mentioned seems to have a bearing, and then what we should have in mind in our evangelical activities, and in answering enquiries, such as "Sir, we desire to see Jesus". I wondered whether it would adjust popular evangelisation and so on.
S.McC. I think what you say is very important, as to whether the way of the cross, and the way of death, as it appears in this chapter, really enters into and characterises our preaching, and our approach to men. Otherwise, we shall make something of the wrong man, and the result that will be produced will be linked with the wrong man, do not you think?
G.R.C. That is what I was wondering, whether this would help us in evangelical ideas.
S.McC. I am sure it would, and it helps us in our practical affairs in life, in hating our life in this world. As has often been said, the Greeks would not hate their life in this world, why it was just their life, you know, to reason and philosophise about things. To put things into philosophy, that was their life. We learn to hate that kind of thing, as having part in the humanity of Christ.
W.D. Is that seen in @Acts 4: 13, "But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlettered and uninstructed men, they wondered; and they recognised them that they were with Jesus"?
{115}
S.McC. I suppose the practical effects of it were seen in their lives. We really have to come to Paul's ministry for the opening up of the doctrine of this, specially Colossians and Ephesians. But, as has often been noticed, before the doctrine is formally unfolded, we have it seen in suggestion in certain things in the beginning of the Acts. Like the body, for instance, we have "Why dost thou persecute me?" That comes in before the doctrine of the body is brought in through Paul.
J.S.E. Is there something peculiarly lovely and attractive in the fact that Jesus can address Himself to two men who are to be part of this much fruit? Does it help us to see that He is delighted with the prospect Himself of having men bound up with Him in this new kind of humanity?
S.McC. I think so, especially taking account of the fact that they were Galilean men. I mean, they were men that would be written off in the world as of little or no account -- men of poor capacity and the like.
J.McK. Would you say a word as to "Where I am"? It is an expression that the Lord uses more than once, subsequent to this passage. Is this a kind of basic idea for all that is to follow in the way of privilege?
S.McC. I think it is. It is mentioned about four times, maybe more, in this section we are reading; the "where I am" would specially bear upon the testimonial position, and matters that arise. Well, it is a great thing to be where the Lord is, in all these matters.
J.McK. That would imply dignity and elevation; the idea of lifted up comes into the section, does it not?
S.McC. It does. It is the way out of the world. That is what is being stressed in John's ministry, the way out of the world in the acceptance of death.
{116}
P.H.H. Is that what is meant in the judgment of this world? It says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out". Is that a reference to the power of His death, and the beginning of a new order of humanity in another world?
S.McC. I thought so. And in the light of that we want to get out of the world, do we not?
P.H.H. Yes, exactly. Do the saints therefore, as being after the order of Christ's humanity, become testimony in the world?
S.McC. They do.
J.G. Is this the answer to Joseph's sheaf, in @Genesis 37, "my sheaf rose up, and remained standing". Is there a link there?
S.McC. Well, we have I suppose in the type a suggestion of it. It is the kind of humanity that could stand the test, and we are all in the testing period, and we are all being as it were, tested, and the question is as to whether we shall stand up to the test. Joseph stood up to the test, whether in the house of Potiphar, or whether it was in prison, or whether it was among his brethren, he stood up to the test.
R.W.S. The expression in verse 25, "shall keep it to life eternal", just what is involved in that, please?
S.McC. That is a very interesting reference, because I suppose we are to take account of how the *it* merges into life eternal. It says, "He that loves his life shall lose *it*, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep *it* to life eternal". That is, as before God, it is a question of how we hold our lives, and whether we hold them in relation to this world, or whether we hate them in relation to this world, but keep them to life eternal. It is a question of the value of things before God in that sense, the 'it' being an abstract allusion to life in its value before
{117}
God, and whether we allow the world to lay hold of it, or whether we keep it to life eternal.
J.M. In the first reference to the death of the Lord here, it is the grain of wheat falling into the ground -- He goes down out of sight. But in the second one He is lifted up, a public spectacle, signifying by what death he was about to die. Is there something instructive in that?
S.McC. It shows the two sides of the truth. In the one side there is the secret mysterious side, known in the assembly, that we are bound up with one another in this order of humanity that is altogether new. But then, on the public side, there is the lifting up; it is the testimony to the judgment of the world, and the judgment of the prince of the world; and then that becomes the centre of attraction.
A.H. When the Greek element is seeking to invade the assembly at Corinth, Paul speaks like this, does he not? He says, Greeks seek wisdom, and so forth, but we preach Christ crucified.
S.McC. Just so; Paul had to take issue with it. The cross, you see, has to do with that, although the cross in Corinthians seems to bear on the lascivious side of man, and his practises. When you come to Colossians, the cross and circumcision bear more on the refined kind of man, the polished man, the philosophical mind, that we have to be delivered from.
A.E.M. I wonder how many of us hate our life in this world. It is a very strong expression and tests us all.
S.McC. I think we should face it. It is a very practical matter as to whether we have sat down and calculated and arrived at this matter of hating our life in this world.
T.J.G. In similar statements in Matthew and Mark, the Lord refers to finding, or seeking to save, and so on; but here in John, the deep-seated emotions of the believer are referred to, hating or loving.
{118}
S.McC. It shows how intense the matter is. Hatred is an activity of love, in that sense.
E.E.H. Would you say a word on this expression, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified"? It is mentioned in this chapter as well as in chapter 13.
S.McC. I think it is important to see how that is. We should go on to chapter 13, to see how the way that is indicated in the teaching of the Lord in these sections makes way for the glorification of the Son of man. The world to come is moved on to our view, and there is a very intimate link between the world to come and the assembly at the present moment in that sense. We do not have to wait till the public day of glory to see the Lord as He is to be seen as glorified. There is a sphere in the assembly now where God glorifies Christ immediately.
A.J.G. So that chapter 12 deals with what is future and public, but chapter 13 is that He is glorified in a moral sense, and glorified in the affections of the assembly?
S.McC. That is it. The last expression in verse 32 "and shall glorify him immediately" shows that God has a realm in the assembly in which Christ is honoured in that way, immediately. It is not deferred, it is not put off for the millennium, or the world to come, it is immediate in the assembly.
A.W. Why is it the Son of man that is glorified here?
S.McC. I think it is to expand the view of the disciples beyond Judaism. Judaism, in this realm of things, has no part; it is entirely outside -- it adds nothing to Christ. The Son of man has a reference to His position universally in connection with man.
W.S.S. In connection with verses 31 and 32, Mr. Darby has a note that the word is literally 'has been', as though the matter is looked upon as having been accomplished. Would that have a bearing on what
{119}
you were saying about the Lord being glorified at the present time in the midst of the assembly?
S.McC. The 'has been' in that sense is the cross. "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is (or literally 'has been') glorified in him", that is the cross, the death of Christ, where every moral issue has been resolved and God glorified in the resolving of it. That glorification is in the death of Christ. Then "If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself" is Deity, involving @John 17: 5; and then "shall glorify him immediately" is the great realm in the assembly where glory is not deferred, but Christ has glory in an immediate way.
W.S.S. I was thinking of the remarkable fact that when Judas went out, the Lord speaks as if the matter is accomplished.
S.McC. Just so. This whole section is dealing with an out-of-the-world condition, for the Lord is going to the Father. He is drawing near, and He speaks, without referring to the actual matter of death, as on that way, and out of the world.
W.C. Is verse 27 of chapter 12 an allusion to Gethsemane in that connection, the Lord going through all this with His God and Father beforehand? He says, "Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour. Father, glorify thy name". It seems to be akin to Gethsemane, does it not?
S.McC. It is very striking that it comes in early in John. I mean there is something to note in that, because the section that we have read from in chapter 13 and then chapter 14, really deals with the section of the Lord's supper. But the instructions in chapter 14, as Mr. Darby points out, must have occurred between the singing of the hymn, and the going out, just before they went out to the mount of Olives, just at that juncture.
{120}
J.S.E. Would you be free just to go over those three salient points you stated just now? I am sure it would be well if we could all get hold of that.
S.McC. You mean as to the glorification of the Son of man? Well, I am not saying anything new, I am only saying what I have been taught, what the rest of us have been taught. In verse 31, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him", that has to do with the cross and the death of Christ; it has not to do with Him at the right hand of God, it has to do with the cross, and the death of Christ. Then verse 32, "If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself", that is, glorify Him in God, in Deity, and that involves @John 17: 5, the glory that He had along with the Father before the world was. But then "shall glorify him immediately" brings in the Spirit here, and the assembly formed, and a realm in which Christ is glorified.
C.K. Would you think that the position that John takes up as suggestive of the assembly as you have said, in the bosom and on the breast, would have that in view?
S.McC. I think it makes way for it. Where you get an active state of love, or a passive state of love among the brethren, as suggested here, it makes way for the opening up of the truth as to the Person of Christ. So that Ephesians is on that line.
J.M. In chapter 16 it says of the Spirit, "He shall glorify me". That would be in the assembly now.
S.McC. Just so.
J.T.Jr. We cannot overlook the fact here (verse 21), that "Jesus was troubled in spirit".
S.McC. I think this section is very important in that relation. But we would be glad to get any help as to what you were thinking of now.
J.T.Jr. Well, the trouble in the previous chapter,
{121}
you note, was in regard to what was immediately before Him, His death; but this trouble was in regard to conditions amongst the twelve.
S.McC. This is very important. It is not the Greeks coming up from the outside, it is what was in, as you might say, the bosom of the assembly. It is the terribleness of what is inside, "one of you shall deliver me up". That is a very sobering and testing matter, because the Lord is laying it on the disciples, in this sense.
P.H.H. Would the disciple leaning on the breast of Jesus be the support in view of that condition of things?
S.McC. I thought so. I thought it was the assembly as bound up with Christ in this great matter of affection that becomes a means of salvation in regard to this awful element. Mr. Darby said once, in connection with this kind of thing, and referring to the statement of men that the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church, that the church was victorious when the opposition was from without, in relation to martyrdom; but when the opposition arose from within, in defection and degeneration, what was within succumbed to the power of the enemy -- a humbling thing in the dispensation.
R.G.B. Is that why the love of Christ is referred to peculiarly in this chapter? At the beginning it says "having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end", and then immediately, you get the reference to the devil. Is the experience of the love of Christ peculiarly needed to sustain us in such circumstances, and help us to be victorious?
S.McC. That is what one is thinking about in suggesting this passage. We need to rely more on the support of the love of Christ in the assembly, in meeting this kind of thing. Association thus with an evil principle, if it is in a person or otherwise, is far more likely to overcome us than bitter opposition
{122}
from without. Judas represents association with evil on the inside. It is "one of you".
P.H.H. So in chapter 21 the bosom is not mentioned; it says "who also leaned at supper on his breast", verse 20. It is just the support of the love of Christ in that setting.
S.McC. Exactly. The breast is interesting in that way, and the support that it affords, for it is the framework.
A.J.G. I was just going to refer to that incident in chapter 21. The Lord told Peter to follow Him, and he immediately turns, but as he turns he sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, and then it says, "who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up?" The Spirit of God makes much of this fact of John leaning on the breast of Jesus, as being able to face the terrible condition that the Lord indicated in relation to Judas.
S.McC. Do not you feel it is very important that if the spirit of betrayal is to be met, it can only be met, as it were, in this kind of environment, where the brethren are bound up together with Christ, in the enjoyment of His affections, as typified in John? The Lord had indicated the matter to them earlier, but apparently here they did not realise it; they did not realise the seriousness of it. The disciples therefore looked one on another, doubting of whom He spoke, and yet He had indicated to them earlier what was among them.
C.H. Are we not therefore to be intelligent as to the progression of evil, as well as the Lord's progression in the thoughts of God? It says earlier, that Satan put it into the heart of Judas, but now Satan entered into him. Is that more active? There are many things that may come into our minds, and in the light of the cross we can judge them, but if they are not judged, do they make way for Satan himself?
{123}
S.McC. That is a very solemn matter, and certainly should affect us in that sense, that Satan finds a door in the heart of Judas through which he can enter to betray Christ, and every action against the truth is in principle a betrayal of Christ. We want to see that.
C.H. Peter says to Ananias in @Acts 5, "why has Satan filled thy heart?" There had been collusion in evil, and that makes way for Satan filling the heart.
S.McC. Satan gets a peculiar advantage through collusion in that way, to attack the economy, and what the assembly is in relation to it.
C.H. There had been collusion here with Judas and those outside?
S.McC. Just so.
E.C.R. The Lord was saying in chapter 12 that His soul was troubled, but in chapter 13 that He was troubled in spirit, as though the matter is intensified.
S.McC. Just so. And the reference to the spirit is very interesting, because it is Himself, you see; the Lord was the spirit of His own body. We have a spirit, of course, but it is different with us, the Lord was the spirit of His own body, and the spirit is Himself. He was troubled in spirit, because the whole assault of the enemy in the betrayal is on Christ.
T.J.G. Does the fact that the disciples were unaware of the betrayer indicate the alarming fact of the terrible deception that must have been going on with Judas amongst the disciples?
S.McC. I think it is a salutary word for every one of us. I feel it is for myself, that unless the spirit of self-judgment is maintained thoroughly in your heart, it will open a door for Satan to move against Christ and the assembly.
J.T.Jr. The Lord was feeling things in His spirit, it says, "Jesus was troubled in spirit". It is therefore a question now of the spirits of the brethren, a
{124}
question of what you might feel. The Lord knew, of course, and He said, "one of you shall deliver me up", but He did not act on it, I mean to say, you might know a thing in your spirit, that it is not right.
S.McC. I think it is very important that the Lord knew about it all the time, but then He waited for the overt act. An overt act came in in which Judas was fully exposed, but the Lord had a judgment as to him all the way through. And we are to be concerned as to the nearness to Christ, as in the bosom and on the breast of Jesus, that we should have a judgment as to things, do you not think?
J.T.Jr. "What thou doest", He says, "do quickly". That is, there was the doing of the thing, "What thou doest, do quickly". That is, the Lord is really allowing a person to do something that brings out what the thing is.
S.McC. And that is important to see. We do not go into the divine province of the heart of man, for God is the heart-knowing God. We do not go in there and read what is in there; we take account of what comes into operation, what is done, and what appears, what was in the Lord's mind in telling Judas to do the thing.
A.J.G. Do you think it was encouraging in that sense that the Lord is in complete control of the evil as well as the good, so that He can tell Judas to do it?
S.McC. I think it is an anchor for our souls, that we can count on the Lord, as we are with Him, as suggested in John. We might thus be helped in meeting this kind of thing, which is all around and which comes into the very bosom of the assembly as in this 13th chapter of John.
A.W.G.T. Because it was not merely a deception, it was an overt attack. The word Satan being used, means the adversary, is that right?
S.McC. Just so.
P.L. In that sense, the Lord peremptorily addresses
{125}
Satan, does He not, in Judas? In a certain sense He says no more to Judas, though of course Satan is in Judas. Now the Lord is tracing the thing to its origin, do you think?
S.McC. Yes. It is a remarkable thing in that relation that when it was Peter, and what Peter said, the Lord said "Get thee behind me, Satan", but the Lord never said that to Judas. There is an interesting point there, for the Lord allowed the matter to work out with Judas until the thing covered the man entirely, and the Lord says, "What thou doest do quickly".
Ques. Is there a difference between the two questions? In Matthew you get what appears to be on the side of conscience, "Is it I, Lord?"But here, it seems to be a question of intimacy, "Lord, who is it?"
S.McC. I think it is important to see that the Lord begins with saying "one of you". That is. Judas had part with the twelve; he was one of the twelve, and the Lord is emphasising that, "one of you". Then the answer to the question comes through the one who is in the place of intimacy and nearness, he says, "Lord, who is it?" as if to say, Who could it be that would be guilty of such a dastardly act?
H.J.P. What is the significance of the Lord dipping the morsel and then giving it to Judas?
S.McC. I think it is to show us the dispensation of grace. Judas could not say that he did not have every advantage, neither could Saul, in the Old Testament. He was given every advantage, for the Lord must have washed the feet of Judas. Think of it, washing the feet of Judas! What must have been in the Lord's mind as He washed the feet of Judas. But there it was. The Lord gave him every advantage to repent, and to judge things, but of course, Judas did not.
{126}
M.A.W. Would this help us to understand why John says of the Lord "full of grace and truth"?
S.McC. Yes. Now we should have a word as to @John 14, as to the new position, and how we are bound up with Christ in this matter of life, and bound up by the Spirit with divine Persons in this wonderful unity of love, this oneness in affection that comes on to view in verse 20. But the reference to the Spirit in this section, bringing on the new footing on which things were to be, and in which things are now, is very important, because it is an assembly footing. Even if it comes down to "If any *one* love me", the whole section and context is dealing with the presence of the Spirit and the truth established on an assembly basis and footing.
G.R.C. Is that why the importance of knowing the Comforter is stressed by the Lord? He says, "ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you".
S.McC. It is important that we should know the Spirit, and that we should understand what the Lord says here in that relation, "for he abides with you, and shall be in you". He said earlier "that he may be with you for ever". The Spirit thus goes through in the dispensation, and the assembly goes through in the dispensation. Whatever may have come in, publicly, we see here the great side of mystery in the presence of the Spirit in the assembly going all the way through. It is not just what is conditional, but "he abides with you, and shall be in you" is from His own side.
P.H.H. Do you mean that in the later verse, verse 23, "if any one love me, he will keep my word", that has an assembly connection? Is that what I understood you to say?
S.McC. Exactly. It is like @Matthew 18 -- "If two of you". It is not just two persons, it is two persons on an assembly footing, two persons of assembly
{127}
quality. And when the Lord says here "if any one love me" it is in this environment and context where the Spirit is viewed as having come in and things on this new basis.
A.J.G. So that verse 20 gives us what is knowable, what is to be known, in the day of the Spirit in the assembly, and then verses 21 - 23 give us the conditions under which they will be actually realised, having in view what has come in in Christendom?
S.McC. That is very important, subjection to the commandments.
A.J.G. First keeping His commandments, and then keeping His word.
S.McC. Just so. Obedience in that sense is the great test at the present time.
A.H. Is the reference to the word "Judas, not the Iscariot" to be understood in the eradication of the principle that the Lord had exposed?
S.McC. No doubt it has.
W.F. The Lord says to Philadelphia, "Thou hast kept my word". Does that show what is possible in the abiding presence of the Spirit here?
S.McC. I think it does. I think we have in Philadelphia a state of things in which this part of the truth is arrived at, and seen. In Philadelphia we have believers that have returned to the truth of the assembly, as it is in the mind of Christ, and they are not only standing in it, but they are marked by the practice of the truth that is proper to it.
E.E.H. Would you open up a little what is meant by "because I live ye also shall live"?
S.McC. I think it is to bring out this matter of contact with Christ, that in life it is not just a matter of doctrine. We have the doctrine of life unfolded all the way through, but it is a matter here of our association with Christ, and that we are bound up with Him in life, and that stands over against all that is around.
{128}
R.G.B. Is there any link with what is said in @Colossians 3, "your life is hid with the Christ in God"?
S.McC. Yes, I think it involves that Christ is our life, and our life is bound up with the Person thus apprehended and known, in relation to glory. Then "in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you". How could that be possible apart from the Spirit? As Mr. Taylor referred to it in the latter part of his days, it is the great binding power of the Spirit, that we are bound up together with one another by the Spirit. The Spirit is the binding power. And divine Persons in the economy, in the divine arrangement are bound up together by the Spirit, and we are bound up with divine Persons in the arrangement by the Spirit. The Spirit is the great Fulcrum in the truth in this section.
A.P.B. In verse 19 the Lord says "but ye see me; because I live ye also shall live". Does that confirm what you were saying, that it is not just a matter of doctrine, but by the Spirit's power and presence, seeing the Lord in His movements and in His active life, that we live?
S.McC. Yes, it opens up the great spiritual realm, and our participation in life, and our being bound up in life in one another and with Christ by the Spirit in it.
J.T.Jr. It is like Moses, God showed him the whole land. He showed him everything from that point of view. I suppose in this section in John the whole land is ahead of us?
S.McC. Very good. You get the expression "all the truth" coming in later. The whole land would be like that; it is not just part of it. That would help us, so that whatever defection comes in, we have the whole truth in mind, and nothing but the whole truth.
{129}
SPIRITUAL UNITY IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN (6)
@John 17: 1 - 8, 20 - 26
S.McC. The brethren will readily see how in this chapter spiritual unity as seen in the ministry of John comes before us in the most dignified and refined kind of way. We are now in the presence of one divine Person speaking to another; one divine Person in the condition of manhood, speaking to One who is unseen, and yet in another way, has been seen in Himself, in the Lord Jesus, the Son. In the previous chapters the Lord Jesus has been speaking to the disciples, going over the truth with the disciples, but now He is speaking to the Father with His eyes lifted up to heaven, and the subject of the speaking is very full and rich, and into it comes the thought of the unity or the oneness that we have been considering. The Lord is speaking to the Father about the apostles, and about us who come in as believing on their word, and about the assembly. So that the assembly appears as in the divine mind in this section as the most wonderful vessel in the universe of God, for it would anticipate that. Its capacity, its formation, its intelligence, will for ever be unique through all eternity. The epistles of Paul to the Colossians and the Ephesians develop it in its fulness and greatness, and it all has in mind, I suppose, specially what the assembly is as the vessel of praise. @Ephesians 3 and @Hebrews 2 refer to the assembly in that particular greatness and richness in which it is viewed as the vessel of praise, the vessel of glory. I thought perhaps we might think a little of the holy agreement, and arrangement in which the Persons that are before us here are viewed, in the unjealous
{130}
relations of love, the subject being the saints. It is a wonderful thing that God has come into this arrangement where we have the three holy Persons in it, the Father, and the Son and the Spirit, all having in mind the great divine end in relation to men, for their own pleasure and glory; and we, not only as coming into it, but bound up with the holy Persons in it, for we are to be one as they are one.
P.L. How true the Lord is to the position He has taken in manhood, that He should ask the Father to glorify Him.
S.McC. It is very affecting to take account of that, the dependent position in which He is viewed in a gospel, and environment in the gospel, where the greatness of His Person is stressed. It is very interesting that in this great chapter, where as has often been referred to the Minister of the sanctuary comes before us in the Lord Jesus, the great subject matter that is unfolded should begin with eternal life and end with sonship, eternal life and sonship being the greatest blessings that God has in mind for men. It begins with eternal life and it ends with sonship. These thoughts expressed in the Lord's words stress the heavenly and spiritual character of the order of things that we have part in with Himself.
W.H. Why did He say in verse 1, "Glorify thy Son", speaking in the third person, and then in verse 5, He says "glorify me"?
S.McC. The first verse involves the holy arrangement to which we have been referring in the economy in which the Persons in wondrous holy agreement are viewed, as to the completing of matters and the working out of Their great thoughts. The fifth verse takes us beyond that arrangement; it takes us back, for it views the Lord as having His place in Deity, outside of that arrangement.
A.L.R.T. Would it be right to say that He has that place still as man, or is that going too far?
{131}
S.McC. When you say, 'He has that place *still* as man', what do you mean?
A.L.R.T. You said that He has this place in Deity. Has He this place as man?
S.McC. Well, in all things we need to be governed by the scripture, and especially in speaking about these things. Verse 5 says, "and now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was". The Lord asks as man, to be glorified with the glory that He had along with the Father before the world was. So it would be right to say that He has returned to that as man. Abstractly, of course, He never left it.
A.J.G. Is this verse brought in in our hearing so that while partaking in the greatest privilege in association with Christ, we should have definitely in our souls, the light of His personal glory in Deity, and thus His pre-eminence?
S.McC. I think that is just the thought. We should remember that mystery attaches to that, for it is dealing with what is infinite and we are finite. If Deity comes within our range in Christ, to be known by us insofar as God can be known by the creature with finite mind and understanding, we have to see how dependent we are on the Spirit. We are to remember that we are in the presence of mystery, that we cannot penetrate, or enter into, or explain.
A.E.M. There is no change in the Person.
S.McC. That is an important thing always to keep in mind. Whether we take account of Him in Deity, or whether we take account of Him as Man before us, the Person is the same, unchanged and unchangeable.
G.R.C. So that verse 5 is the *glory* of Deity, it is not a question of Deity itself, which ever attached to the Lord, even when here, in manhood.
S.McC. So that we, with the help of the Spirit as considering it, would revert in our thoughts to
{132}
@Philippians 2: 6, "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God; but emptied himself, taking a bondman's form". It brings before our souls the greatness of this Person. Whatever change there would be, it would be in what was external.
G.R.C. So that in this gospel, do we not see what is meant by the fact that He did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God? He says, "before Abraham was I am", and He makes other statements which His enemies knew meant that He was equal with God. Is that so?
S.McC. Just so. And in this chapter, while His co-equality with the Father is before us, yet He maintains the dependent position, which He is in, in asking of the Father certain things.
H.V. How far does this verse take us, "Thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world"? It says in @Hebrews 1: 2, "by whom also he made the worlds".
S.McC. Well, it takes us as far as we can go, indeed it takes us beyond where we can go. The expression in verse 24 "thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" is to impress our minds and our hearts that between the holy Persons in that place, there was love; not that we can say much about it, or that we know much about it. It is undisclosed, except that the love that was there has come into the relative position. But there was love between the Persons there, just as there is love between the Persons in the economy.
G.R.C. As to the Deity of the Lord Jesus, it says in @Colossians 1: 19, as to the time when He was here on earth, that "in him all the fulness (of the Godhead) was pleased to dwell". As to His present position in verse 9 of chapter 2, it says that it dwells in Him bodily. All the fulness was dwelling in Him, was it not? Men could not discern that, but it was there.
{133}
S.McC. These two verses in Colossians are very interesting, and help as to what we are referring to in connection with the holy arrangement, where the Persons are seen in relation to one another. In chapter 1, we get the expression "all the fulness of the Godhead", or "all the fulness" it might read, "was *pleased* to dwell, and *by him* to reconcile all things to itself". You do not get that in chapter 2. You do not get "was *pleased*", neither do you get the mediatorial thought immediately. Chapter 2 does not emphasise the mediatorial thought; it is a question of the greatness of Christ personally, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily", but the word 'pleased', in chapter 1, brings in this matter of the holy arrangement, where the Persons are viewed in relation to one another, and one Person is viewed as in connection with the work of reconciliation, "by him to reconcile all things to itself". It emphasises the relations in love between the Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in this holy arrangement. Mr. Darby uses the unusual word 'covenant' in "Notes and Comments"; not in the sense of the old covenant or the new covenant, but just in the sense of the understood arrangement between the Persons.
H.W. You spoke of the Lord asking to be glorified with the glory which He had before the world was. Would you let us know please what you have in your mind in regard to that?
S.McC. The allusion is to the external form. @Philippians 2 shows a change as to the external form, not as to essential glory exactly. Christ Jesus emptied himself taking a bondman's form.
C.M.M. Would you confirm that Scripture does not say that He left the form of God?
S.McC. Scripture never says that, nor does it say that of the Spirit. Nor would it be right for us to say that of either the Lord or the Spirit.
{134}
C.K. Would you say a word as to verses 4 and 5 being reciprocal, "I have glorified thee on the earth", and then following that, "and now glorify me, thou Father"?
S.McC. That is one of the things that is in mind that we should be affected by, for all the arrangement in the relations that are before us in these Persons are to affect us. So that there is mutuality with us, and reciprocity of feeling and affection, in regard to matters as they work out in the economy.
G.R.C. As to verse 5, it is a question of the glory of Deity here, is it not? It is not Deity itself, which the Lord never left, of course; it is impossible to think of such a thing, but it is the *glory* of it.
S.McC. That is to be emphasised. It is not a question of change as to His Person; it is the external form as J.T. pointed out.
A.J.G. You have in mind in this chapter, from what you said at the outset, the very exalted character of unity that is in mind for the saints. Is that in view of their position here in testimony, the Lord Himself having been here in testimony?
S.McC. I think so. And as the chapter works through to the end, it also has in mind the service of God, in the position that the Lord anticipates, "I in them". Both sides, do not you think, would thus be in mind? The matter of eternal life, as it appears here, is therefore very important. We have just heard that our brother has been taken to the hospital, and we have just heard from other parts of the world about death coming in; these are very real and practical matters, and they affect our spirits. So that we are to see the bearing that eternal life has in this exalted setting, so that our spirits should be set free and lifted above the pressure of death, while feeling it. Would you go with that?
A.J.G. Yes, I would. Would you think that eternal life known and enjoyed is a great background
{135}
to, and support for, the position in testimony, and also is essential if the service of God is to be entered upon in fulness?
S.McC. I would think so. I suppose, Mr. M., in regard to what you have come through, you would say that eternal life has had a great place in helping you to keep above the infirmity?
A.E.M. Yes.
S.McC. It is to help us all, so that we are not overburdened with what keeps men under, in the world around us; the world to come, the millennium, is contemplated anticipatively in the opening verses.
J.O.T.D. Has the use of the word 'flesh' any connection with what you are saying? It is not man, nor men exactly, but "all flesh".
S.McC. I think what is in mind in the chapter is men, not angels. That is why flesh is used; men are in mind, and not angels. The angels would like to look into these wonderful things, for man is God's great thought in the final working out of things. So that flesh would bear on men, and in the world to come you have men in conditions where sin has operated, but God shows His triumph, under the headship of Christ, in that that is subordinated through His power.
P.L. So that Christ being "the head of every man" (@1 Corinthians 11: 3), would link on with this, would it not?
S.McC. It would. "As thou hast given him authority over all flesh" would allude to the Lord's place in headship, in that sense.
A.P.C.L. And would the fact of the life eternal being presented as the matter immediately before Him in relation to His being glorified show what a place it had in His mind in regard of these persons that are before Him?
S.McC. I think it is important to see that. Eternal life in that sense is not an afterthought; it is a
{136}
primary thought with God, but it is a primary thought, as we have been taught, that God has made relative. Sonship was a primary thought, but it was never, as it were, altered in relation to relative conditions. Eternal life was in divine purpose for men, but, when sin came in, God moved eternal life into the relative position to meet the need that arose in the human heart. So that it is a primary thought now made relative to the need in men occasioned by sin.
J.T.S. In relation to the Lord having authority over all flesh, it says, in the closing chapter of Isaiah, "it shall come to pass from new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, saith Jehovah". Will that be the outcome of the Lord's authority over all flesh?
S.McC. No doubt. The world to come will be a wonderful realm of things, but it is not so great as the present realm of things that we are in in the assembly; it is not so great as the present time. So that the Lord, while He opens with that, channels our thoughts into the exclusiveness of the present time, "that as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal", and He works down to "the men whom thou gavest me out of the world".
T.J.G. In verse 2 is "all flesh" the widest possible thought, and is the expression "that as to all", including only the saints of God? I am asking, or is there a difference between "all flesh" and "all that thou hast given me"?
S.McC. I think so. I think there is a wide general view as to the authority over all flesh, and then there is a specific view "as to all that thou hast given to him". We are to notice these two parallel lines of thought that run all the way through John's gospel, from the first chapter to the end; there is the great general thought, and then the specific thought in which certain ones are specially in mind.
J.S.E. Could I ask a further question about this
{137}
matter of flesh, for I believe we all need help about it? Does the inclusive term "all flesh", as bearing upon the world to come, include the restoration of normal relationships between the animals according to @Isaiah 11, and when that is all set out, does God resort to His fullest thoughts in dwelling with men, without allusion to any other kind of creature?
S.McC. I think men are His primary thought, and chiefly in mind; and the lower creation incidentally is affected in relation to man who is the centre of creation, as @Psalm 8 would show. All creation is made to revolve around the central figure in it, which is man, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?"
M.P.S. Would you therefore say something please about verse 3, and the expression "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent", in particular?
S.McC. We had it in this very hall, from this very part, the thought that the true God delivers us from idolatry, and Jesus Christ, the true Man, delivers us from lawlessness; we have got the true pattern of manhood in Jesus Christ. "Other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ", @1 Corinthians 3: 11.
J.P.H. In verse 6, to which you referred; is the speaking in a similar strain to what the Spirit gave through Paul in @Ephesians 1: 4, "according as he has chosen us in him before the world's foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love" -- the men that were the Father's and were given to the Son?
S.McC. Yes, and eternal life is one of the blessings that we are blessed with in Christ Jesus in the heavenlies. We have been blessed "with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ" and eternal life is one of them, sonship is another. These are great and wondrous thoughts involving man.
J.P.H. I was referring to the end of verse 6
{138}
primarily, "*They were thine*, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word".
S.McC. Yes, they belonged to the Father, in counsel, as we might say. But it is important to see that the Father does not give them away, just as in @John 3 in regard to the things, when it says "the Father loves the Son, and has given all things (to be) in his hand". That does not mean that the Father has given them away, that they are not the Father's any more. The point is the arrangement, and the Lord Jesus as the great Administrator in it. The great Operator in it.
H.F.R. Does the supremacy of the Father shine out in these expressions, "as to all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal"? And then "the men whom thou gavest me out of the world". The Lord does not take the place of selecting Himself, it is those that the Father has given to Him.
S.McC. I think it is very important that we should see, in relation to that, the great place that the Father has, the Father and His name. We should see too how the Lord, on this upward way would fill our minds with thoughts of the Father's greatness and of the Father's glory, for the name "Father" is the crowning feature in our dispensation. It is the name by which God is specifically known, in contrast to "Elohim", or "Almighty", or "Jehovah". Father is the name by which He is specifically known in this dispensation and it represents the crown of the dispensation, in that sense.
P.L. All to enrich the service of God with these spiritual feelings seen in Christ?
S.McC. Just so. All this is intended to bring about richness in our souls, so that we are not just using mere terms, in assembly service, in the service of God, but we are enriched in the knowledge of the Father.
{139}
H.W. Could we view the statement made in @John 1 as underlying all this that we are speaking of, "Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" -- the restoring of the relations between God and His creature in eternal life?
S.McC. That is very interesting, because, as we know, that looks on to the world to come, when God by His power, through the Lamb, will deal with what has entered into the ordered system in which His pleasure was once.
H.W. I thought it would help us in our souls to view that as the basis on which God is securing all these great thoughts.
S.McC. Yes, it would.
G.R.C. Is that implied in verse 4, "I have glorified thee on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it"? Did not that work that He completed culminate in the offering of Himself, as it were, upon the altar of burnt-offering?
S.McC. Exactly. In the very scene where sin had come in, and evil had raised its head, the Lord says "I have glorified thee". We have the emphatic '*I*', and the emphatic '*thee*'. "*I* have glorified *thee* on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest *me* that *I* should do it".
A.H. Would it be right to think that what the Lord now says in verse 5 has in mind what Paul is speaking of in @Ephesians 4: 10, where He goes beyond creation in order that He might fill all things?
S.McC. That would involve His place in that sense beyond the created realm. We cannot enter there; He can enter it because of who He is, and what He is.
R.G.B. Is the choiceness and greatness of the assembly in mind in the reference to the men, that they are capable of having the Father's name manifested to them, and then they are capable of keeping the Father's word?
{140}
S.McC. I think so. I think the whole chapter in that sense would bring into our minds the greatness of the assembly, as the vessel that is peculiarly in the divine mind at the present time. The assembly is divinely capacitated and divinely formed to take in these communications, to receive them, as it says, "they have received them", alluding to the apostles.
P.H.H. You said earlier the assembly is to be the vessel of capacity and intelligence. Would you say a little here about the Father, and God? I would judge that the saints have good intelligence as to that, but there is still some hesitation in some places. I wondered if we could ask you for a minute or two on that. Does it enter into the intelligence of the assembly, as the vessel of praise, that it knows the different settings of these two names?
S.McC. When you referred to hesitation, would you say a bit more about what you mean.
P.H.H. It has come under my notice, for instance, that some in the service of God are very free to speak to God as Father, and are full and happy in it, but when it comes to what the Lord speaks of later, in @John 20, "my God and your God", the fulness of what is contained in that does not seem to be such a happy portion. So that with some, at any rate, while the truth is not opposed, it is not voiced.
S.McC. I would feel for myself that if that marked one, it was because one did not know the Father. I do not think that any person, any believer that knows God in the parental relation, as the Lord has in mind that believers should know Him, would have any difficulty about God in the general position, involving His supremacy, and involving what He is, known as Father, Son and Spirit. I think perhaps you would say something yourself, but the whole burden of the Lord's ministry here is bearing on the knowledge of the Father, and if that knowledge has been rightly received and we are rightly formed in
{141}
relation to it, we shall not have much difficulty in traversing the path with Him from "my Father and your Father" to "my God and your God".
P.H.H. Yes, I fully follow that, and agree with it. Even here in the early verses, verse 3, for instance, the Lord is speaking to the Father, and says "Father", but He also says "that they should know thee, the only true *God*". I understand what you mentioned earlier that the true God delivers us from idolatry, but the expression "the only true God" must contain a great deal more in itself, would you say?
S.McC. Abstractly it would. But here, of course, it is the Father.
P.H.H. Yes, it refers to the Father here; I am clear about that.
S.McC. Wherever you get the word 'God', there is a fulness in it that we could never detract from. But then, Scripture does differentiate and distinguish between God and Christ at times; so that we would have to go by the Scriptures, and speak as Scripture speaks. The word 'God' never loses its fulness, but yet distinctions are maintained in Scripture, and there are certain passages which could be quoted, where God and Christ are viewed as distinct.
G.R.C. But I suppose the term "the only true God" here is in contrast to "false gods". It is not intended to exclude the Son and the Spirit; it is not exclusive in that sense.
S.McC. No reference to God excludes either the Son or the Spirit or the Father abstractly. Nowhere in Scripture does any reference to God, in that sense, exclude any of the Persons abstractly. There must always be in our minds, even in speaking to one Person as God, the light as to all three.
P.H.H. So that on the lines on which we are going now, in John, you are never very far away from the Trinity, and would the expression used in @John 20, "my Father, and your Father", detain us,
{142}
and so to speak bathe us, in the sense of the gracious name that God has taken on in order that we might be filled with the thoughts, and the grace of the Father?
S.McC. Yes. And you I am sure would say that we cannot put the Trinity into the name Father. There is only one Person involved in that name. So that we have to be governed by Scripture and the context in which names and appellations appear.
P.H.H. By saying not far away from the Trinity, I meant that we are in the presence of the Son, He is speaking, and we are in the presence of the Spirit, by whose power we reach that position, and we are before the Father Himself. Does not that help us on?
S.McC. So that we are always reminded of the mystery that we are in the presence of, and of what we cannot explain or define. While Persons come on to our view concretely, in the Father, the Son and the Spirit, sometimes together, sometimes singly, there is always a mystery surrounding the position, that we just cannot fathom or explain.
A.P.C.L. You were saying that the knowledge of the Father is what would enable us to proceed restfully to God; when the apostle is asking the Father to strengthen the saints in @Ephesians 3, he speaks about "according to the riches of his glory". Is that so that their affections might be filled with the riches of the Father's glory in view of their arriving at the full thought suggested in being filled even to all the fulness of God?
S.McC. I would think so, and this section of John's gospel is to impress us with some of the riches of the Father's glory.
A.P.C.L. I was thinking that. I am very thankful for what you say as to that particular matter, because the Father's place is a critical thing, is it not, as in the economy?
S.McC. So that there would be great care in
{143}
assembly service that the Father's portion should not be diminished, and that the sweetness of the Father's name should not be lost sight of as giving character to the whole dispensation. It is the Father's name that gives character to the dispensation.
J.T.Jr. I was thinking of what Mr. H. was referring to as to the Trinity. I thought that John's ministry, really in regard to the recovery of the truth, shows how we arrive at Paul, and that is the question of how we arrive at the Father, because we have the Father here in this chapter. I think it would lead therefore to what Paul says, that it is through Christ and by the Spirit that we have access to the Father.
P.H.H. That was what was in my mind in speaking about the Trinity. Does not that lead us into a position of fulness, you might say? And do we need therefore, to remain, detained in that position, as Mr. McC, has just said, and not to move too quickly or on too small a scale, through the portion which is for the Father.
J.T.Jr. That is what I thought. Therefore the arriving at Paul through John really leads to what Paul says in @Ephesians 2, as to the moral side; that is, the blood in @Ephesians 2 precedes the thought of access. I think the moral side is involved in the statement here, the Father is the only true God.
S.McC. And would you say that we cannot rightly approach the side of what is spiritual, and what is linked with purpose, without the moral side?
J.T.Jr. So we are brought nigh by the blood of Christ in @Ephesians 2, but access is by the Spirit, it is through Christ and by the Spirit. That I think is the point that should be understood more in the assembly, in the Lord's supper and what follows the Lord's supper.
S.McC. You mean the great value of the Spirit in regard to the access?
J.T.Jr. Quite so. The blood is that we are
{144}
brought nigh; but it does not say access there, the access is by the Spirit. Therefore it is a question of the state of soul really, the state of the saints that is in mind in arriving at the Father.
J.S.E. Have you in mind. Mr. T., that being brought nigh is the divine side of the matter, but "through him we have both access by one Spirit to the Father", is what we take advantage of for the enjoyment of relationship?
J.T.Jr. I would think so. It is therefore a question of experience in what we are saying, because the question of unity comes in here, and in what we have mentioned already, as to receiving the words in verse 8, "for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received them". It involves really the words affecting the intelligence of the saints in the assembly.
S.McC. The emphasis on the Spirit as the power for access as bearing on our state is very important, because we have got abundance in the ministry in regard to terms that can express our thoughts, but what the Lord seems to be getting at all the time is our state, in relation to the spiritual side of the worship of God.
A.W. Is there a reference to the Spirit in "these things Jesus spoke" in that verse, because Jesus spoke of the Spirit?
S.McC. That is very good.
E.C.L. Is there a way in which the Father serves us in this matter? I am thinking of the way the Lord seems to hand over the men to the Father, whom He had kept "in thy name". Later on, too, in verses 16 and 17 and also in @Ephesians 3, being strengthened by the Father's spirit. Do we have the Father's service in helping us to the further side of the worship of God?
S.McC. I think so. I think the Lord here is impregnating their minds and souls with the thought of the Father, and the Father's name, and I think
{145}
the Spirit now would do so. The Lord has gone on high, He is still, of course, the Minister of the sanctuary, but the Spirit augments the whole matter of the praise, and He would keep the Father, the Father's renown, the Father's name before us. I think what Mr. W. has referred to in that sense is very interesting, at least I have not noticed it before, if we could just refer to it for a moment. In verse 1 it says "These things", well, what is that? that Jesus spoke. It refers to what has gone before in chapters 13 to 16, and the whole subject in this section is the access, "I come to thee". Therefore what Mr. W. points to is important, "These things Jesus spoke" would have a reference to what the Lord has said in regard to the Spirit.
J.S.E. Would "these things" include His allusions to the Father, in His words to His own?
S.McC. I think they do. All the way through, they involve the Father, they involve the Spirit, they involve Himself, they involve the truth. But the Spirit has a peculiar part in what the Lord is stressing in the truth running alongside of the knowledge of the Father.
J.McK. As helping us into the fulness and gain of these relationships.
J.T.Jr. "These things" in verse 1 of chapter 17 allude to chapter 17, do they not? I think the "these things" of chapter 16 would point to what Mr. W. says. But I submit that, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said", I think refers to what He was going to say. Is not that so?
S.McC. I had not understood it in that light. I thought it referred to what had gone before.
J.T.Jr. Maybe it does, but I had never looked at it in that way.
S.McC. It says, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven". Would that not
{146}
indicate that the lifting up of His eyes to heaven was after He had spoken?
J.T.Jr. I thought it was a new subject in this chapter, it was what He was proceeding into, but the thing is right in any case, that is, the "these things" in chapter 16 would include the Spirit. He begins, chapter 16, "These things I have spoken unto you".
S.McC. My understanding of it is that "These things Jesus spoke", refers to the previous chapters, and then "and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come" brings us into @John 17.
G.R.C. Could we have another word as to Ephesians? Chapter 2 has been quoted, as to access to the Father, but could we have a word as to chapter 3, where the apostle says "in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him", verse 12? Would it be right to think that the access of chapter 2 of Ephesians would link with what is said in @John 13, as to the Lord departing out of this world to the Father, and chapter 3, would be more "he came out from God and was going to God"? I believe Mr. T. has made some remarks on those two chapters recently, but I was not present.
J.T.Jr. Well, I think that what we have understood in chapter 2, is that we arrive at the Father through Christ and by one Spirit. But in @Ephesians 3 we are strengthened by the Father's Spirit; it is the Father's Spirit, the thought is carried forward in the Father. That is what I understand.
G.R.C. So that you mean there we arrive at the fulness of God. The Father helps us in that.
J.T.Jr. By the Father's Spirit, it is the Spirit in that connection, that is the Father's Spirit.
S.McC. We get the thought of access, too, in @Ephesians 3. It is very remarkable how it comes in there in verse 11, "according to the purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,
{147}
in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of *him*". That is the access is linked with the faith side in chapter 3, whereas it is linked with the Spirit in chapter 2.
G.R.C. And so the Father would strengthen us by His Spirit that Christ might dwell in our hearts by faith. Does not that suggest that the whole realm is now before us, in connection with the fulness of God?
S.McC. And is it not to stress that we are still in the faith state; we have not reached the thing in actuality? Chapter 2 bears on our state in our relations with one another. The work of reconciliation in chapter 2 involves unity of affection between Jew and Gentile, and between the brethren, affecting the state of the brethren in their relations with one another. But when you come to chapter 3, it is the realm of God, in which the mystery of God is seen, and faith seems to be stressed. Chapter 3 bears on our state in relation to God and the realm of God.
A.P.C.L. Is there a significance therefore, in connection with the access, that in chapter 2 it is "through him", and in chapter 3, it is "in him"? I was thinking that man in Christ has the great scope of the position in mind, has it not? One is access to God, we might say, but in chapter 3 it is a question of the one in whom we have that access. Would that be right?
S.McC. So that the "through him" is instrumentality, the "in whom" involves the status -- "the assembly in Christ Jesus".
A.J.G. Chapter 2 is specifically to the Father, whereas chapter 3 is general, is it not, we have boldness and access?
S.McC. Without referring to the Person you mean. Just so.
C.J.H.D. The prepositions 'by' are different in the two verses. "*By* one Spirit" is 'in the power of', and in verse 12 of chapter 3, "*by* the faith of him"
{148}
is 'by means of the faith of him'. Does that help at all?
S.McC. Say something more as to what you understand about it.
C.J.H.D. I thought there was something personal in the way of our access to the Father, in the power of one Spirit, the unifying effect that that would have upon us. Whereas, the expression as to faith in chapter 3: 12 is an instrumental matter, "we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him". That appears to be an instrumental matter.
S.McC. Yes. It is "the faith of him". "Through him" in chapter 2 is the instrumentality in the Person in the mediatorial position. "The faith of him" brings in a characteristic thought emphasising faith.
A.C.P.L. But then, it is right to see that that access is said to be in the Person. By means of the faith indicates, as you say, that we are still in that position. But is not the access said to be *in* that Person?
S.McC. Yes. "In whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him".
A.P.B. Could we ask who is referred to in the "him" at the end of that verse?
S.McC. I take it it is Christ Jesus our Lord, the One in whom we have the boldness and access.
J.McK. Does it involve mediatorship, specially in this realm?
S.McC. Well, it does. The whole realm stresses the need of it, so the Christ, the great Operator, is dwelling through faith in our hearts, in the very centre of this great realm of God.
J.McK. Do you think that in a practical way in the service, it is important to be in the joy of relationship before we can expand to God in relation to the whole realm?
S.McC. I think it is. We have often gone over it,
{149}
the name of Father and the relationship into which God has come in that light is to enrich our souls, and to help us on the lines of greater intimacy; so that when we come into the general position linked with God as Christ's God, we are not overawed by the majesty of who He is, as exalted as Head above all.
G.R.C. Is that why the word 'boldness' is added in @Ephesians 3? With the Father there is everything attractive, there would be no thought of fear, but in @Ephesians 3, it is "in whom we have boldness and access".
S.McC. That is interesting, so that eternal life and then sonship, which comes in at the end of this chapter, are to help us so that we should be without fear, without fear or pressure of death, because in the assembly we are in a deathless state of things, and then we have sonship, bringing in liberty.
J.McM. Would verse 24 of chapter 17 help in this, "Father, as to those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory"? Does that link with the faith of Him, that Man there?
S.McC. I suppose that verse conveys to us the Lord's desire that we should see His special distinctiveness and uniqueness in this realm that He speaks of, "where I am they also may be with me". As has often been noted, we do not share in that glory; there is nothing in it that we share in, it is what is distinctive to Himself; we contemplate it.
W.McK. In view of spiritual intelligence in unity and balance in the service of God, could I enquire if the Lord's words here, stressing the Father so greatly, are to imply that the Father should have the greatest portion in the service of God? There seems to be some lack of clarity about that among us.
S.McC. I should think we would have to take the scripture, and the teaching in the scripture as it appears, and where it appears, and John would, in
{150}
his ministry, impress us with the thought of God in the parental relation. That is the great thought in John's ministry, that God has come into the relationship of fatherhood; and there is a glory attaching to that that is to affect us.
E.C.M. Is that why stress is laid on the quality of love here, in view of the radiation of those affections in the assembly?
S.McC. It is to help us in that way as to the quality and the richness that enter into assembly service.
W.M.B. Could I ask a question as to the help we may need as to the distinctive glory of the Father, in Himself, as apart from our enjoyment of relationship with Him? Do we need help and liberty as to the worship of the Father Himself?
S.McC. I think John's ministry would help us as to that, because the Lord refers to the thought of the Father Himself, and we are to think of that. It is not only what He is, in the sweetness and preciousness of the relationship in which we stand to Him and He to us, but we are to think of His personal glory, and the choiceness that is linked with it as in this gospel.
W.M.B. I wondered if that would help in relation to Mr. H.¬s question as leading us to the fullest thoughts about God.
S.McC. I think it would.
P.H.H. And would we get in the Lord's utterances to His Father in the gospels, specially John, something which would help us greatly to speak in richness to the Father? What Mr. B. speaks of is also a matter of enquiry, I would suggest, because very often we have limited ourselves to the position of blessedness in which we, as the saints, are before the Father. But to go on to speak to the Father about Himself, and His glory, is not so readily with us.
S.McC. J.T. often referred to the relationship
{151}
into which God came in fatherhood. He said that He took up a relation well known in the human family, the relation of father. In the human family, there is the father, and the children; there is the sweetness of the link between the father and the children. But then there is what the father is himself, which may stand related to other things beside the children, and the father's glory would be bound up in that personal side, I would think.
A.J.G. Do you think the very fact that He not only has the assembly before Him, but also takes pleasure in many families, heavenly and earthly, shows what He is, what the expansiveness of His love is, and His desire to be known in that tender relationship throughout the whole universe?
S.McC. Yes. So that in the sense and enjoyment in our souls of the relationship between us, we would love to think of Him as He would stand out related to other things as the "Lord of the heavens and of the earth", and as putting His impress upon the many families.
P.L. The Father's house setting forth an eternal family sphere, filled with the shining of the Father to the satisfaction of His own love.
S.McC. All that would help us to see the importance of the Father. Mr. Taylor taught us that the Father not only puts His impress on this dispensation, but He puts His impress on the eternal state into which we are going. If that laid hold of our souls, we would see the magnitude of what is involved in the thought of the Father, the majesty and the greatness of what is linked with the thought of the Father.
A.H. Did not Mr. Darby refer to the angels being brought into it as well?
S.McC. It says "the tabernacle of God is with men", well, where are the angels? We must make room for the angels, it *may* include abstractly the
{152}
angels, because the tabernacle of God with men is an abstract thought.
W.R.M. Does the word 'Father' always refer to one Person? It says in @1 Peter 1: 17 "And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time of sojourn in fear". The matter of judgment comes up in connection with the Father.
S.McC. I would say that is one Person that is on our view, concretely, but abstractly, we must keep in mind that we are in a realm that involves all three Persons. In @John 5 we have the word, "for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son", and @Hebrews 12 says we have come "to God, judge of all". I would say, in verse 17 of 1 Peter, that the Father personally is in mind, as God, in that setting, in His fatherly care of us in holiness.
A.P.C.L. Is not the point of that passage that it is "if ye invoke *as* Father"? It is a question of God being before us, but *as* Father, in that Person.
S.McC. That is important. It is God *as* Father. And that helps as to @Hebrews 2, which bears on the service of God. The context always helps us, that God in the parental relation is before us in @Hebrews 2. The teaching of Hebrews generally bears on the majesty of God, and the greatness of that Being, but then, chapter 1 opens up with God Son-wise, God speaking Son-wise. But chapter 2 deals with God Father-wise, it is God in the parental relation, bringing many sons to glory.
W.C. Will you say why, when it speaks of the Father in relation to the families in @Ephesians 3 and goes on to speak of His Spirit and so on strengthening, it says "that the Christ may dwell", not that the Son may dwell? Is that leading God-ward, so to speak, the passage finishing up with the fulness of God?
{153}
S.McC. I think it is in that sense, because it is the faith state, and the great Operator is still before us. We are still in the faith state, it is leading us on to the fringe of eternity, but it is still the faith state, and the Christ the great Operator by which we are reaching eternity, as it were, is in the centre of our affections.
A.P.C.L. Would you be free to tell us now the final thought of unity that you have before you, in the closing part of chapter 17?
S.McC. I think it is very affecting to see the way that divine Persons are bound up with One Another, and we are bound up with them, and we are bound up with one another in this holy realm of infinite love, yet we are finite in it. What can we say about it? I think it would help us to see the value of the Spirit. We have been referring to the access by the Spirit, and while the Spirit is not formally alluded to here, how could this be possible apart from the Spirit? And therefore the essential need that our state should be right.
Ques. What do we understand by the expression "one in us", near the end of verse 21?
S.McC. It says "that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". It is a perfect state of love, persons in one another in a perfect state of love. You cannot have it apart from a perfect state of love, moral issues with us must be solved and settled. It is by the Spirit of course; it is not just by thought in the mind.
P.H.H. Does that help us to understand what you were saying about the Spirit as the binding power?
S.McC. We heard about that before the Lord took His beloved servant, and it always affected one. We would like to have heard more about it, but J.T. referred to this section, and how divine Persons are bound up with One Another, in the holy arrangement
{154}
linked with the economy, and how the saints are bound up with Them in such holy nearness and intimacy. The thing is profound, and it brings out the distinctness and uniqueness of the assembly's capacity and formation, that she is so near to the Deity, as contemplated in the arrangement here.
A.W.G.T. Does the latter part of verse 21 indicate that that is in view of the day of display?
S.McC. Yes, the millennial world would be in mind there. But Mr. T., you remember your father making the reference, in that reading in Nostrand Avenue, to the remarkable way in which divine Persons were bound up together in the economy, and the way the saints were bound up together.
J.T.Jr. Quite so. So it gives us an experience as together; that is the experiences together in these meetings should have that result, so that we have the Father, and the Son, and we are with Them in it.
S.McC. Do you not think the way we are bound up together is a good note to finish with? By the Spirit is a very real living and practical matter, would you say?
J.T.Jr. It is really the proof of things, that we experience in these meetings, that God is here, that is that the Father and the Son, and we -- the men -- are bound up with them by the Spirit.
{155}
SPIRITUAL ROYALTY
S. McCallum
@Esther 5: 1 - 3; @Lamentations 1: 1 - 6; @Song of Songs 6: 13 to end; @Song of Songs 7: 1; @Psalm 45: 8 - 11
The thought in mind, dear brethren, is to say a word on royalty, spiritual royalty, first in the book of Esther, where we have remarkable references to what is royal in the midst of testing times, which would help in regard to our own times, when things are so difficult. In fact, all the scriptures that we have read, even @Psalm 45, deal with light which comes to the people of God in difficult times. And especially do we need to see the importance in our day of spiritual royalty, because, as we may have often heard, the saints belong to the ruling class. We have been referring to the Lord, in our hymn, coming in to rule, and we shall be with Him in the rule, in the administration; He will not come out without us. It will be a wonderful time in that day, when the Lord will have the assembly fully with Him, by His side, linked in all the blessed administration of that scene. And the present time is to prepare us for it, royalty with the saints is developed now; there is the side in connection with that which is conferred upon us through grace, the wonderful operations of grace, in that God has taken us like beggars from the dunghill, and He has set us among princes, the princes of His people. So that the ministry of the glad tidings in Romans opens up before our souls the wonderful operations of God in putting us amongst the ruling class, in putting us, in the midst of all the splendour and glory of His kingdom, where so much is spread before our souls, as in this book we get the hidden allusion in type to the wealth of God's kingdom,
{156}
when in the first chapter the king is displayed, and there is set out the glorious wealth of his kingdom. The epistle to the Romans brings in the great thought of the throne, an essential feature of the truth in regard to God in our relations with Him, that we have to face, so that every feature of our will is subjugated, and brought under the moral sway of God in grace, grace being on the throne, grace reigning, in the present time. Righteousness does not reign today, righteousness is not on the throne; righteousness will soon be on the throne, but grace is on the throne now, and grace is in the ascendancy in our dispensation. What an advantage we have in that sense! We have every advantage; whatever may be adversative in our lives, whatever we may think is standing against us, it is well to remember, as the truth of the glad tidings opens it up to us, that grace is reigning, grace is on the throne. It is a regal thought, a royal thought, over against all that is so common around us, and so degenerate as the fruit of man's will, and the dislocation that has resulted from it; when servants are seen upon horses, and princes walking on foot, as Solomon, the preacher, in the book of Ecclesiastes refers to it. The result of man's will is the dislocation of everything in the scene around us, but the result of the assertion of God's will, in its supremacy in the glad tidings, is that our wills through grace, and God's moral sway in it, are subjugated, and brought under the influence of that will. That brings in what is conferred, and I speak to the younger brethren in the light of the glad tidings for it is a great thing to see what is conferred upon us. The truth of the gospel in the epistle to the Romans is to build up our souls in the knowledge of divine gift through what has been conferred upon us through gift. So that we have eternal life, sonship, great and glorious as these blessings are, moved on to our view on the line of
{157}
gift in the truth of the gospel. It is so that our souls should be built up in substance, in property. Abraham had the light conveyed to him that the people would come out with property, they would come out with substance out of Egypt, and it is on this line that we are indicating in the truth of the glad tidings in Romans.
But then I wish to speak of royalty from our side, how it is developed with us, and entered upon from our side, especially in view of difficult matters, and difficult situations. We are to be above what is mean and petty, as belonging to heaven, and only here for the moment in the way of testimony. We are to carry heavenly manners, royal manners and dignity as belonging to heaven, and belonging to the expanse, and the ruling class, into all our ways; whether it be at school, whether it be at business, whether it be in the local assembly, royalty, heavenly dignity is to mark us, wherever we go. It is interesting in this book that we have so much reference to what is royal. If you go through this book and count the number of times that the word 'royal' is used, I believe it is more than in any other book in the Scriptures. And this is of note and of interest, because God's name is not mentioned in the book. The circumstances are very difficult for the people of God, and yet God's name is not mentioned throughout the book, it does not appear in the book, as to the actual record. But, as we have often heard and often thought of it, He is behind all the scenes in the book. We can count on God wherever His people are concerned, wherever the testimony is concerned, that while, because of certain outward conditions in that which bears His name, as the people of God are in captivity. He may not be apparent on the public side, yet He is moving behind the scenes and, as we have heard often, He is moving the scenes that He is behind, for the help and blessing of His
{158}
people. We are in similar days, dear brethren, for on the public side there is much to humble, as we think of the spirit of Vashti, the resistance of headship, the woman that would pave the way for the rival head in Haman, for that is what she really does. We want to get accustomed to the glory of headship, the wonderful glory that is spread before us in @1 Corinthians 11, before the Supper is taken up in its ordered setting and right location in the assembly. We get the wonderful glory shining in relation to God, Christ, the man and the woman, referring not exactly to what is in the assembly although inclusive of it, but referring to the public position, where sin has dislocated so much, dislocated everything, we might say, in man's world; so that woman is out of her place, and man is out of his place too, in relation to Christ and God. We want to see the wonderful glory that is shining there, the glory that makes way for the Lord's supper, and the glories that follow. It is not only, you see, dear brethren, glory in the heavenly sphere, but glory linked with the position down here, moral glory as Christ's and God's headship is accepted, over against the spirit of the world around us, where the authority of headship is refused, and such dislocation has resulted. Vashti represents that spirit, and she is displaced as that spirit will be displaced. It will be displaced in the coming day in a full way, but how important, dear brethren, that it should be displaced in our hearts now, that there should be no room for the spirit of Vashti, the spirit that does not submit to the truth, the spirit that is not in subjection to the truth. How important the edict that is given forth, and the principle established, that every man should bear rule in his own house. Surely that is an important feature when we come to Christianity, and to the truth of the assembly. Indeed, if a man cannot bear rule in his own house, how can he bear rule in the
{159}
house of God? How can he take care of the assembly of God? Therefore, dear brethren, it is important that our households should be under control, in the light of the dispensation of grace. Grace is on the throne, not the law, not the peremptory demands of the law, but grace on the throne, and that is not only to enter into our position in the assembly, but it is to enter into our household economies, working out through the head of the house, through the woman, through the wife, down through to the children. There may be things that issue has to be taken with, as the enemy seeks to bring in dislocation, we are not referring to that; we are referring to the importance of every man bearing rule in his own house. So that as things come into our houses, if we are as husbands in the testimony, the responsibility devolves upon the head, as to all that comes into the house; and it is important that the spirit of Vashti should not be present in the house, but that full room should be made for headship. However poor we may think our husbands are, however weak we may think some of them are spiritually, let us make room for the great divine thought of headship, for therein does the glory of God, and the glory of Christ shine. And we are to have part in that wondrous matter, the angels looking on, in regard to the great thought of the woman having authority on her head, as in this wonderful scene of the testimony, where the divine order is preserved, in the saints as recovered to God, recovered to the truth, through the glad tidings.
So that Vashti is displaced, but Esther comes into her place. That is, we have one coming on to view in Esther, who brings in what is divinely effected, as we would speak of it in our day. She had come under right influence and care, and we can thank God for the right influence and care that we come under, because it all has in mind the introduction and development of royalty. Esther is going to fit into
{160}
the affairs of the king, she is going to have part in the wonderful affairs and matters of the kingdom, and all that is linked with it; and we want to see, young people, that we are coming into great affairs, great matters, matters that involve the glory of the kingdom of God, as we would speak of it, and therefore the need of care and preparation, the need of subjection, the need of yielding to every right influence that comes out from God through Christ toward us to affect us rightly. It is so easy to get under wrong influence, but how important it is that we should come under right influence. Esther came under the influence of Mordecai, and what an influence it was! What a genuine care for the testimony he had, and how important that there should be Mordecais amongst us, how important that there should be the influence of Mordecais, how important such influence is to heaven! And he has in mind Esther, he has in mind this great thought, and his ears are fully alive and his hearing acute in regard to what is transpiring. He knows that Vashti has to be replaced. He knows, as we know, that the first has to be set aside, and the second has to be established; and Esther is coming into this. It is not an easy matter, as we see in the course of the book, and it is not an easy matter you see for all of us, the practical and experimental learning to pass from what is natural to what is spiritual, first that which is natural, then that which is spiritual. In the truth of the glad tidings it involves much sorrow and bitterness of soul, as we go through it, but Esther comes under the hand, as we have often noticed, of Hegai, the chamberlain. Mordecai sees that she comes under, not only his influence, but that she comes under the influence of Hegai, the chamberlain, one who is typical of the Spirit. There is thus a process linked with her training and her education, for this great position in royalty that she is to fill,
{161}
therefore, dear brethren, the stress in Romans on the Spirit. How we need to see the stress and the emphasis on the Spirit, especially in the early part of @Romans 8, for the Spirit is to be everything to us, in view of our training, and in view of the development of royalty in us. Spiritual royalty means that not only does grace reign, but that *we* reign, as Romans has in mind as to believers, that they are to reign in life, through the abundance of grace. It says, "much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ", @Romans 5: 17. Royalty involves that there is a moral and spiritual supremacy with us in our circumstances, that we are not dominated by them, but superior to them. How important it is for all of us, that we should not be controlled by circumstances, how circumstances are made excuses, how they are brought up time and again, as to our spiritual prosperity, and our spiritual buoyancy; it is as if we would use them as an excuse, whereas God in the wonderful things He has conferred upon us through grace, would build us up in this great thought of royalty, so that we are superior to our circumstances, that they do not control us.
Well, the times comes, to be brief, when a crisis has to be faced, and Mordecai is maintaining the lead, he has got a judgment of Haman. Haman represents the rival to Christ, the rival to all that is of God raised up in the testimony here in this world. He is a bitter opponent of the truth, as we would speak of it. He has no use for anyone, as we might say, but himself; he stands out in his own estimation, and the result is that sorrow is involved for the people of God. But Mordecai comes into the position, and we can always be thankful, dear brethren, in every part of the world, for the spirit of Mordecai coming into the position. It is the spirit of Christ coming into the position, in view of the holding of
{162}
the ground, in faithfulness, in refusing to yield to the spirit of Haman, that for us looks on to and points to the rival head to Christ, that this world will soon make room for, and in relation to whom the apostasy will set in. We want to see the spirit of Christ in Mordecai, in adamant refusal to yield to this spirit that is seen in Haman. It brings out the hatred of Haman, as it always will bring out the hatred of the flesh, but the spirit of Christ in Mordecai has in mind this matter of royalty, and in all our localities, dear brethren, the spirit of Mordecai, or the spirit of Christ in Mordecai would have in mind this thought of royalty. In the first part of the book, it is what is put on Esther, as under the care of Hegai, but we come now to the fruit of the blessed influence of Mordecai, when the life of the people of God, the life of the testimony is jeoparded, and Mordecai indicates to her that she has come to the kingdom for such a time as this. Think of the time that we are living in, and the question is as to how we are all shaping up in it, how am I shaping up, how are you shaping up? We have the indication in this book of how Mordecai shaped up in this crisis. With Esther, you see, there is a little bit of doubt to begin with, but the persevering strain in Mordecai, in the spirit of Christ, in our localities, will see that Esther comes out as she should come out, according to the divine mind. So it says, "on the third day Esther put on royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the entrance to the house". Notice the emphasis on *royal*, what is royal. The emphasis on this is important at this juncture, because it is a question of the deliverance of the people of God. It is a question of their lives, it is a question of the life of the testimony. And therefore the moment arrives when we are tested as to what we should do.
{163}
Esther is told not to imagine in her heart that she will escape -- none of us will escape, dear brethren -- we all come under divine review, we all appear in our hour, in our day, in our time in the testimony, and the question comes up with heaven, and in the sphere of the testimony, how are we shaping up, how will we do, how will we act? Mordecai is in sackcloth; he feels the position publicly, he feels that the people of God should be subjected to such strain and pressure through the wilfulness and wantonness of a Haman. He knows the origin of that foe, that relentless foe, and he will not yield for a moment to him. And he is seeking that Esther might be brought into the matter, as we are all to be brought into the matter, and she puts on the royal apparel. We have been speaking about coming before the king, coming before ordered Government in this world; we want to see that we have got the royal apparel on, that we are different kind of persons, we belong to the expanse. I know that evil has come into the expanse, Jannes and Jambres are there, Philetus is there, and Hymenaeus is there; they will not be always there, they will soon go out of it. They are there, and how they got there is something we have to ponder. But we want to see that we belong to the expanse too, the assembly belongs to the expanse in this sense, and soon we shall be manifested in that relation, in the ruling, royal dignity that attaches to us as coming out with Christ. But in the meantime we have to have a judgment as to all that are in the expanse, so that we are not deceived by Jannes and Jambres, and Hymenaeus and Philetus, men who have erred as to the truth. We are to see it, Paul sees all that and he puts us on our guard in regard to it. Royalty would understand that, and it is developed in our souls. Believers as developing in the thought of royalty would see that that all belongs to what is going out of the
{164}
expanse, but the saints are coming into the expanse, in the sense in which I am referring to it. And so Esther puts on the royal apparel, and we are to put on the royal apparel. It is a question you see, of what is different. There is so much of what is common around us, and I believe, in the present time in the testimony, we are challenged as to whether we are prepared to sacrifice, to take our lives in our hands, and put on the royal apparel, and go before the king in the interests of the testimony, that the truth might survive, that the people of God might survive, and that God and Christ, as the book shows in type in the end, might come into their universal supremacy. Oh, to think that we have part in it! Young brother, young sister, to think of your part as an Esther in this glorious system of things, where God's supremacy is eventually to be known, and where the victory is known to faith. How important to see the royal apparel in this relation!
Now I want to refer to it in the other passages. I want to refer to this matter of royalty in the Lamentations of Jeremiah, for it is very striking how it comes in. I am not pressing it on the masculine line, I am going to trace it on the feminine line. We have had it in relation to Esther and now in Lamentations the reference to the princess; chapter 1: 1. We are to see how the feminine line comes into the matter of royalty, how it comes into the matter of the ruling class. Indeed, if we do not see that, we shall miss the divine thought, for the divine thought in @Genesis 1 is that the masculine and the feminine are both involved in the matter of rule and government, in the universe of God. We want to see that, and the great place that Christ and the assembly has, and these passages typically are to develop us along the feminine line, so that we reach the full thought in @Psalm 45, in the queen by the side of the king, in gold of Ophir. That is the full thought of royalty,
{165}
not a half thought, or a quarter thought, but the full thought -- the queen in gold of Ophir. It is over against the circumstances in which the remnant are viewed in the second book of Psalms, the power of antichrist running high, cast out as they are, beyond Jerusalem, remembering the precious things that were linked with Jerusalem, but having in their souls the light of the king, and the light of the queen, in the fully divine appointed way, in gold of Ophir. But we have to face the matter of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and how royalty develops as we face the broken and the ruined conditions around, where things are being reduced to such commonness among men, where that which bears the name of God, and bears the name of Christ is held in such scorn around us; where the enemy publicly seems to have gained the day, and has made headway, bringing the assembly publicly under the influence of the world, in her alliance with it. The Lamentations fit into that. Jeremiah had seen royalty on the masculine line in Josiah in a wonderful way, just as we have seen royalty on the masculine line in our days through the spirit of Christ operating in leaders in the revival: J.N.D., J.B.S., F.E.R., J.T. Oh! the royalty, dear brethren, in these beloved men of God, these beloved servants of God! Just like Jeremiah saw it in Josiah, that leader raised up in kingship in his day, and the great revival of the truth under his leadership and influence. What precious features came into view through royalty in Josiah, beginning early, as it did. I would commend it again to the younger brethren, that royalty begins early with us on the masculine line, as it did in Josiah. There is power to deal with things in our souls, that are contrary to the truth, power to deal with things in our lives and circumstances, that are contrary to the truth; so that we should come into the ruling line, to exercise moral power in our localities, as having first dealt with
{166}
things in ourselves. No one can exercise moral power in any locality, that has never dealt with things in himself. @Romans 7 helps us to deal with things in ourselves, to analyse good and evil, to put evil here, and good there; not to mix them together, but to put them in their proper places. And as we begin with ourselves, bitter and severe and sorrowful as the exercises may be, some of us perhaps, almost having gone out of fellowship in working out the exercises connected with @Romans 7, but Oh! the blessing that results in the knowledge of the Deliverer, and the knowledge, as in the eighth chapter, of full deliverance by the power of the Spirit, and the presence of the Spirit. These are great things, young brethren, these are great things to all of us. Josiah began early, and we think of the ruling class set out in Josiah, and Jeremiah had seen it. He had seen the wonderful way in which the truth was recovered, and in which leadership was maintained, so that the truth had its place, so that the holy ark was put in the place that Solomon, the son of David the king of Israel had built. We have also royalty seen in Solomon and David! We have a book on it, you know. I wonder if we have all read it. How many are the books we have not read! 'Royalty and Headship seen in David', what a book it is! Josiah got it into his soul, and we are to get it into our souls, royalty seen in Christ, as typified in David. And Jeremiah had seen it and his soul was affected by it, but he saw that the state of the people was not equal to it at that time. However powerful the influence of leadership was, there were things that had to be faced amongst the people, and the Lamentations bear on it. So that we are challenged, dear brethren, as to the time when such leadership as we have referred to is absent; we are challenged as to whether the enemy is going to have his way. I think not, dear brethren! If there is one thing the Lord
{167}
has shown, it is the product of royalty in leadership in ministry that has gone before, that product is in the assembly, and we love to think of it asserting itself. Well, Jeremiah had seen all this, and now he comes to speak of royalty on the feminine line, in regard to Judah, he says "the princess among the provinces is become tributary". Is that the divine mind? No, dear brethren. We have to feel what God in His government is doing in relation to public condition, and as we accept His government, and the reduction that it brings, and bow under His government, we shall get blessing, we shall get help. Jeremiah speaks in the sorrow of his heart in this book, about God not hearing his prayer. He says in one instance, "Even when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer". And again he says, "Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that prayer should not pass through", chapter 3: 8, 44. Think of these solemn conditions, dear brethren! We have spoken in connection with the book of Esther, that God is not mentioned there, but in this book God is there. He is entering in His government, into issue with what obtains in the public position, and in His government the heavens are shut up. How solemn these things are! But we have the spirit of Christ in Jeremiah, that would be with God, and make a way, as it were, for God to act, as I do believe Jeremiah's spirit did. So that as he ends his book, he sees royalty in the full effect of it in God Himself, as he says, "Thou, Jehovah, dwellest for ever; thy throne is from generation to generation", chapter 5: 19. But we have to face, as the princess has to face, the impurity in her skirts, as it says, "Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore is she removed as an impurity" (verse 8), and then (verse 9), "Her impurity was in her skirts". The skirts relate to our associations, our manners and habits in life; and we are to see that our skirts are clean. We have been speaking
{168}
about the water; the death of Christ in its purifying aspect in the water, is to help us that our skirts should be clean, that there is no blood guiltiness in our skirts. In the book of Jeremiah itself, it speaks about blood guiltiness in the skirts. We are to see that the skirts of our garments are clean. The assertion and ascendancy of royalty in our souls would see to it, as the truth comes before us objectively, and as by the Spirit, it comes into us subjectively, and affects us subjectively, and that we cleanse and purify ourselves from these habits and associations of life that God in His government expresses His displeasure in. Well, that is the moral side, and if we are weak on moral lines, we shall be weak on other lines. We shall never be strong on spiritual lines if we are weak on moral lines. We are challenged as to the moral side of the truth, and how we are facing it, whether we are avoiding it, whether we are passing it by. But we have to face it, dear brethren; we have to face it with sorrow in the public position, but there is a way out, thank God, and royalty comes into view in the way out. So that Jeremiah would help us as to royalty, and the facing of it in connection with all the ruin and the breakdown, and we should see that it is not of God, in the proper and normal sense, that what is of Himself should be in servitude, or tributary to any principle of this world, or the man that is dominant in it.
Now I want to come to the Song of Songs, where we get the development of royalty in relation to the ardency of love. The passage that I have read in chapter 6 alludes to the Shulamite. Dispensationally it points to the great day of recovery and revival when Israel and Judah will be brought together in relation to the advances of the King towards them, and all his ministrations in relation to them, as it says, "Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee". It is a wonderful
{169}
thing to look upon the Shulamite, the feminine counterpart of Solomon! What a wonderful thing it is to look upon the assembly, and to see what has come about in the assembly through divine working, so that the Lord can speak of it, as "*my* assembly" in @Matthew 16, and "*the* assembly" in @Matthew 18. He never tires, as it were, of bringing on to our view the assembly; and any lover of Christ that stands by the assembly, and makes the most of it in their outlook, and makes the most of it in their exercises, will be honoured, as it says of Jerusalem, they shall prosper that love thee. So it says, "What would ye look upon in the Shulamite?" It says, "As it were the dance of two camps". Oh! the unity that will be brought about as Israel and Judah are united through the wonderful operations of the King! They will be united into one, their movements will be one. Instead of the rival kingdoms, instead of the rival parties, as we think of Jeroboam and all that came in through him in Israel, we have come to a time now, when the Shulamite returns, and there is seen, not the dances of two parties, but the dance. All the rivalry is gone, and Israel and Judah are seen as united in response to the ministry; for that is the point suggested in the dance, as the Lord says, in regard to John the baptist, and what was said, "We have piped unto you and ye have not danced". Think of the wonderful pipings when the king will have to do with the remnant, and have to do with Israel, bringing about this wonderful result of the dance of the two camps, as Israel and Judah are united, under the hand of the king. Well, we are to see that in the assembly, that there is a way out of the confusion and the dislocation, in returning, departing from iniquity, and pursuing righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those that call on the Lord's name out of a pure heart, and coming into the wonderful light of the Shulamite, the wonderful
{170}
light of the assembly as in the assembly epistles. So it says "How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince's daughter!" Think of it, not 'how beautiful are thy sandals', but "how beautiful are *thy footsteps* in sandals, O prince's daughter!" It is a question, you see, of our movements in the truth. It is the footsteps, not only the sandals, by themselves, but the footsteps -- the way we have been going, where we have been travelling, and the imprints we have left, as it were. What have they been? Wherever we go, do we leave an imprint of Christ and of the assembly, or an imprint of ourselves? "How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince's daughter!" Then it says, "The roundings of thy thighs" -- no sharp corners here, no difficult corners to manoeuvre or to manipulate. "The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist". Think of the refinement, the spiritual refinement linked with royalty in this relation, the prince's daughter! We need to see our dignity in the eyes of Christ in this light, as returning, as forsaking wrong principles, as forsaking error, as forsaking lawlessness and unrighteousness; and coming into, in the revival, the wonderful features that come under the eye of Christ, in this profile view that we get of the loved one, typical of the assembly. May the Lord help us to see what the assembly is in His eyes, and may He help us to stand by it in all our localities, stand by the assembly, honour it at every turn! None of us is greater than the assembly. No matter how gifted a person becomes, in the realm of the testimony of God, he is not greater than the assembly; the assembly is greater than all when it comes to that. And every one of us is to see to it that we have a proper respect for the assembly, a proper regard for it, and if need be, we are to be subject to it, as recognising that the rule of heaven works out through it.
{171}
Well, just a word in @Psalm 45. We have had the princess and the prince's daughter and now we have the queen. The queen here sets out the full thought of the assembly, it is not an incomplete thought as to the assembly, not just going a little way as to it, but coming into the full thought of the assembly. It says, "Upon thy right hand doth stand the queen"; it is not the left hand, but the right hand. The King for us is at the right hand of God, and the queen is at the right hand of the King, just as we have been saying, in @1 Corinthians 11, where the glory works down. Oh, the relation of the glory in that sense, from God to Christ, and from Christ to the man, and from the man to the woman! Think of the glory, as we might say, projected on to our view, in relation to Christ where He is at the right hand of God, raised by the surpassing greatness of God's power, but given to be head over all things to the assembly. In that glorious place of supremacy, the assembly is with Him; there is no shade of disparity, no sense of inequality, but perfectly suited to be there -- the queen in gold of Ophir. May the Lord help us as to these thoughts of spiritual royalty, that we may see our dignity in the testimony, on the eve of translation at the present hour, and act as those that belong to the ruling class, for His name's sake.
{172}
SPIRITUAL PERCEPTION
E. E. Hoyte
@Mark 8: 22 - 26; @Deuteronomy 34: 1 - 6; @Ezekiel 8: 1 - 6
What is in mind in reading these scriptures is the idea of spiritual perception. To be able to see things from the divine viewpoint is a quality that is very much needed by us, for it is not as we naturally see things. How much this is needed today amongst us, as one matter after another arises in our various localities, calling for spiritual perception. Whether we can see aright in matters is of great importance, and as to whether we can see with God in a matter. As far as spiritual things are concerned we are born blind, and I think sight begins with new birth; that is the first divine operation in our souls and it has that in view, as the Lord Jesus says, "Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom". The first operations on the part of God in relation to us is to open our eyes. That is in the commission to the apostle Paul; he was to open men's eyes. Then the idea came in as to turning from darkness to light and from Satan's power to God, and that they should have the forgiveness of sins, and that they should come into the great inheritance that God has purposed for them. It was to begin with the opening of the eyes, our spiritual eyesight at first has to be opened. So that this is a great matter, and it would seem to me that the divine Persons all have this in mind in relation to us, to enlighten us, so that we eventually come into the knowledge of divine Persons.
Now the first scripture I read, a blind man is before us, so that this is something that is initial. The
{173}
Lord comes into Bethsaida, and they bring Him this blind man, beseeching Him that He should touch him. The Lord has to do with him, and how sympathetic our Lord Jesus was! -- that blessed Man here, for God's pleasure, relieving men of all the pressure that rested on them. Now here this blind man is brought before Him to be touched, and the Lord does not hesitate. He would act immediately, which is a very great feature of Mark's gospel; things are done immediately and without hesitation. 'Forthwith', 'immediately', are words used repeatedly in Mark's gospel, as I am sure we are acquainted with. So it says, "And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village". He led him out; the Lord must have had something in mind in relation to that, to lead him out of the circumstances in which he was at that time before He could touch his eyes. So that sometimes we must be led divinely out of circumstances in which we are found, in conditions that are not clear to us perhaps, or in which we are closing our eyes. The Lord has to lead us out, and we need the Lord's help for that. He then spits upon his eyes, and lays His hands upon him, and asks him if he beheld anything. Why did the Lord have to do that? He could have healed him by one stroke and given him his sight. Think of how these details must be gone through in our souls! It would cause exercise on the part of the blind man; he would, so to speak, be beginning to use his senses. How necessary that is, dear brethren, that we should have our senses exercised to discern between good and evil, so that when matters arise in our localities, we have this idea of full grown men. Full growth is of that nature, that we are able to discern between good and evil. If not, we are of very little value in our localities. If I cannot distinguish between good and evil, how can I defend the things of God in my locality? I am incompetent to do it. And so the
{174}
Lord asked him if he beheld anything. The man uses his senses, he says, "I see men". You say 'Very good to see men', but is that all? So sometimes we see things, but have we the true and the correct vision of things? He saw men as trees walking, and that perception is far from being a perfect one, I should not see men as trees walking. So the Lord Jesus has to lay His hands again upon his eyes. He needed a second touch. So that, is it not a lesson for us, dear brethren, that sometimes if we do not see things very clearly, it is a question of having to do with the Lord again about the matter? Let us go to the Lord, when things are not clear. We should not continue for any length of time. Then it says He laid His hands again upon his eyes, and he saw distinctly. No more distortion, he saw distinctly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly. How much this is needed, dear brethren, that the whole position might be clarified in our locality! When there are matters that need adjustment, the Lord is fully equal to it, there is no weakness with Him. So that if we continue to be distorted in our view, there is something lacking and we need to get to the Lord about it, and He will restore us so that we may see things distinctly. Then he is dismissed to go down to his house. Think of what a different person this man would be as he would go down to his house, no longer blind, but now seeing all things. What an atmosphere he would bring in to his house! I might apply the house to our localities, for that is where it would come in, I now have a right perception of things, I am seeing clearly, and I can be trusted.
Now I would pass on to Deuteronomy. We have here, not a matter of what is initial, but a full-grown man in Moses, the great servant and prophet. What is said about him in @Exodus 3 is that he saw. The angel appeared to him in the burning bush, and he turned aside to see; that is what is said first of him.
{175}
He turned aside to see. And God was so delighted with the man, that He called him twice. Now that is what is said of him in that chapter; he was one who could be arrested by something extraordinary, and not pass it by, not ignore it, but he turned aside to see why the bush was not burned. So that that would apply to us too, would it not, dear brethren, in our localities, that we are ready to look into matters? They are not allowed to take their course; we are not disinterested about divine interests, but we are alert, and ready to turn aside to see things. That is what is said of him. And then further to that, in Hebrews it is said that he saw Him who is invisible. You think of that, dear brethren, between his exodus and this chapter, how much can be said of him. One, you might say, was initial, but in this chapter he is a fully-fledged man, who has gone through the wilderness. He is certainly not a blind man! Think of the service of this great man, and what a personality there is before us in this man Moses -- "the man Moses". As you look into chapter 32 and chapter 33, what a man there is there! What a knowledge of God! He says, "Give ear, O heaven, and I will speak" -- think of a man on earth like that, who can call heaven and earth to listen to his speech! That is the man we are speaking about, this great servant and prophet, who had in his heart the divine purpose for his people, and who could bless them. In this chapter he is viewed as going up to die, according to the word of Jehovah, his course finished. A certain end is reached in the history of God's people in this book; they had been brought out of Egypt, and brought through the wilderness under his leadership, and now they are ready to enter into the territory that God had provided for them. And chapter 33 shows him blessing them. You say, 'Moses, your history is closed, your work is finished and accomplished, you are to die', Moses would say to
{176}
you, 'I have the people of God upon my heart. I want them to come into the inheritance that God devised for them'. How much can we devote to the people of God, how can we look at them? Well now, what he says about these tribes in these chapters is evidence that he saw them established in the divine territory, in the land. And so he is blessing them and He says, "Happy art thou, Israel!" All this is in his soul in blessing them; for instance, when coming to Joseph's blessing, there was nothing but what was precious. You will remember, everything there is precious -- the precious things. How necessary it is for our young people to be able to take account of these precious things! Can I convey this to the people of God? Something of the preciousness that God has devised for them. But now it is not his portion to go into the land, but he had it in the faith of his soul. How he treasured it in his soul. He is not allowed to go over, in the ways of God, into the land itself actually, but what a provision God made for him in that he was to go up to the top of Pisgah, and there he sees something, for he looks into the land as alongside of Jehovah. What a look that must have been, a man on the mountain with God, you might say, speaking reverently, by the side of God, looking into the land, the great divine territory. That is how Moses viewed the whole land, for Jehovah showed it to him. Well, we are in for this, dear brethren, it is open to us to see things from the divine viewpoint. This man had this tremendous privilege of standing here as he had stood before on the rock, and seen the glory of Jehovah pass by. What a man he was! It entered into his personality, and dear brethren, I suppose, that is what we need. It is a question of what we are as a result of divine formation. How wonderful, dear brethren, to look upon each other in this manner today, every one of us exhibiting the divine work in our souls. It struck
{177}
me recently as to the number of dear brethren who are away from us, what a great number this is at these meetings, and yet we are but a small number of God's people, and naturally as we sit down together our minds revert to those who are not with us; we cannot be unmindful of them, we must think about them. So that this great servant heard from the divine lips, "When ye come into the land". As you look back into these scriptures you will find such expressions as that, "When ye be come into the land", and so on, I think that at this point in the history of the assembly, we can say that in some sense at least we have come into the land, I do not think anyone would deny that. The blessed Spirit of God having been given His place amongst us, what blessed times we are having, and how we are entering into the divine realm as led by Himself. So that the need therefore arises for continual purification amongst us. We need purification constantly in order that our lines of communications might be kept open, so that the Spirit of God might have His free course amongst us. The Lord's present service to the assembly is on that line, is it not? He is washing us, purifying us by the washing of water, in order that He might have the assembly for Himself, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. So that as we are maintained in this position in purity, we afford the precious Spirit an opportunity to continue His operations in our souls, and to lead us into the land. So we naturally look back upon our dear brethren who are away from us. We think of them and what they are missing, but what we are missing as not having our brethren with us to enjoy these great things, when we come into the land. It comes to me now that in the year of Jubilee they were all to be set in liberty. How we would welcome that idea, for all our brethren who have gone out from us, that they should be released. How we would invite that!
{178}
What can we do? I think we can ask ourselves. What can we do to relieve our brethren, to release them, so that they are brought into liberty to enjoy these great things that we enjoy? Moses was not permitted to go in, but we have gone into the land in some sense and are enjoying God's purpose for us; and in order to do it we need the brethren, so that perhaps it might interest us to think about it a bit, as to what we can do to help to liberate our brethren, so that they might be free for the service of God.
Now I pass on to the next scripture in Ezekiel, because I want to convey here how the Spirit of God enters into the matter. This is not Revelation, this is Ezekiel, but we are acquainted with the wonderful expressions in Revelation, where John the great prophet, is shown things. We were speaking of that today, how he turned back to see the voice, and Revelation makes so much of what John saw. There is another man who was available to the Spirit, for he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and that is how the vision in Revelation is introduced. And the whole realm of things described in that book are portrayed by him, as the result of that vision, that spiritual eyesight. Lastly, John sees this vessel of divine glory coming down from God out of heaven. We all wait for that, and it says in that chapter the Spirit carried him away into a high mountain, and he saw "the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God, having the glory of God". What a sight that was, from an elevated position! But we are not in Revelation now, we are in Ezekiel, and it is of much interest to me to think that the Spirit is spoken of in this way in Ezekiel. As we all know, He has a great place in the book. But here is an extraordinary thing, in this chapter, for Ezekiel is taken up by a lock of his head, and the Spirit lifted him up between the earth and heaven. You think of that, what an extraordinary thing this is -- a
{179}
man available to the Spirit. It is a vision, of course, but it is not written here simply for the sake of reading, it is something to help us in relation to the blessed Spirit of God. This man is available, and so the Spirit lifts him up, and transports him to Jerusalem. But it is not now to see something positive and great and blessed and wonderful, but to see this image of jealousy, showing that we need the Spirit's help, whether to see what is positive in the way of blessing and the divine inheritance, or in order to be able to see what is evil. I have often thought of this passage -- a man being transported through the heaven, from where he was, for he was in captivity, to Jerusalem. The divine mind was to show him things, that was the point, to show him this image of jealousy, this abominable thing to God. So it says "the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entry of the inner gate that looked toward the north, where was the seat of the image". Then in verse 5, "he said unto me, Son of man, lift up now thine eyes toward the north". Think of the Spirit of God taking these pains to bring him to this point! He therefore wants him to see, he is not to miss, he said "lift up now thine eyes toward the north". He says, "And I lifted up mine eyes toward the north, and behold, northward of the gate of the altar, this image of jealousy in the entry. And he said unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, to cause me to go far away from my sanctuary? And yet again thou shalt see great abominations". He leads him in the chapter from point to point, to see the great abominations. The Spirit of God would have this man to see what they were going on with in Jerusalem at that time. So that, dear brethren, we need to be available to the Spirit of God in order that we might be able to see things. We need to see what
{180}
God would bring before us at the present time, in our localities, so that we might have a clean place, clean conditions in which He can operate, and bring about conditions that are suitable to God. Not this unholy condition, and idolatry that is here. Think of how the blessed God must have felt it to see it! We cannot close our eyes to what is around us in Christendom, and to all that is coming in, but what is the object in mind in our seeing it? It is that we ourselves are to be on our guard against it, and to be separate from it, so that we might be free for the service of God.
May the Lord help us to this end for His name's sake.
ONENESS
W. S. Spence
@John 17: 11, 20 - 23, 26
We have been hearing about the necessity of spiritual perception and how important it is that we should be spiritual persons; the thought of spiritual perception is a very extensive one, covering a great many aspects of the truth, moral and spiritual. I am thinking now of the need of spiritual perception in going through the gospels, to enable us to understand, with the help of the Holy Spirit, what is the mind of the Lord Jesus. Our brother has referred to Ezekiel being lifted up by a lock of his head, and we might well cherish that everything connected with us should be so regulated that we might be moved by the Holy Spirit as easily as that. In chapter 43 of that book, Ezekiel is again easily moved; he is lifted up, and sees the glory of Jehovah filling the house; it is the glory side of things that is before me at the moment.
We have been occupied with the important matter
{181}
of unity. God has unity before Him, and I suppose the consummation of it will be when everything in heaven and earth is headed up in Christ. What a day to look forward to! But it has many different bearings, as we have been noticing together, and one's thought is that reference to these verses might serve to emphasise in our minds and affections what has been before us, and link on with what may, if the Lord will, occupy us on the morrow. This afternoon we were considering what the Lord Jesus Himself said in chapter 10 of this gospel, in relation to the sheep and the flock. How sobering to listen to the Lord's own words and to remember that what He said involved His going into death. In verses 14 and 15 He says, "I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep". How much might be said about that! "As the Father knows me, and I know the Father", We are brought into that kind of knowledge, known and knowing in this wonderful way. But how touching to think of the Lord saying, "I lay down my life for the sheep". How it stirs our affections, dear brethren, to think of the Lord Jesus having laid down His life for us, that we might be brought into this wonderful relationship! Our affections will be moved eternally, I am sure, but we need to have our affections stimulated now in connection with this great service of our beloved Lord for *us*. But then He speaks of the flock, and says (verse 17), "On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again". He does not now say for the sheep, that is not now the primary thought, I judge, in the blessed Lord's mind; He is thinking of the Father, thinking of God; and what He had come to secure for the delight of the Father's heart eternally. It is wonderful to think of the love of
{182}
Christ going to the point of death in order to secure that which would satisfy the Father's heart! And to think of the love of the Father, having, if we might so say reverently, a fresh impulse in relation to His beloved Son in His yielding up His life to this great end, that there should be *one* flock, and *one* shepherd.
The words in chapter 17 which are in my mind particularly are, first, in verse 11, "that they may be one as we". They are very simple words, but they are very wonderful. Then in verse 21 He says "that they may be all one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us", and then in verse 22, "that they may be one, as we are one". May the Holy Spirit help us to enter a little into what is in the mind of the Lord Jesus in these simple words. They are wonderful, infinite, and we shall never exhaust them, and may the Holy Spirit help the servant who speaks, to say just a word about them briefly.
"That they may be one", the Lord says in verse 11. This section of the chapter refers, as we have been saying together, to the servants, primarily to the apostles, that they should be one, as the Father and the Son are One, in the work that they were now to undertake. The Lord Jesus said, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work" and He would have those who carry on the work to be one with Them in it. That is a very great thought for us to ponder over. Primarily the apostles were in mind, but it comes down to our time, for the service goes on to the end of the dispensation. The Lord Jesus is looking down the whole dispensation to the day of glory; an important thing to have in mind in reading this marvellous chapter! The service goes on; every service rightly carried out has a unifying effect, and is, I believe, only carried out rightly as in this oneness with the Father and the Son. One almost feels that it is too much to say that all true service
{183}
must be carried out in that way, but I do not think it is, because the Lord Jesus says "that they may be one as we". It necessarily involves the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not mentioned in this chapter, but it is only by the Spirit that there could be this oneness. I think there is an instinctive feeling of hesitation in the use of the word 'unity' when speaking of divine persons. Unity is rightly used, I need not say, in regard to the saints, but the Lord says "that they may be *one*", and it is this "oneness" into which we are brought. As John says in his first epistle "that ye also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son". Now the last request the Lord makes in regard to the servants is in verse 19; He says, "I sanctify myself for them". Those two words "for them", should be pondered. "I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth". The Lord is going to the Father and, in this chapter, marvellous to think of it, as a Man here on the earth, in all the blessedness of His manhood. He says so simply to the Father, "I come to thee". Those simple words have greatly impressed my mind -- "I come to thee". The Lord, as going to the Father, says, "I sanctify myself *for them*, that they also may be sanctified by truth", that is in order that we should be set apart for the service which is before the Lord's mind in this section, that is set apart by the truth as it shines in glory in Christ, from everything that makes up the present evil world. In Ephesians, it is "according as the truth is in Jesus"; this, by the Spirit, shines upon us from the glory, and separates us from the evil in the world, such for example, as our brother has been speaking of in @Ezekiel 8, in order that we might move in service here in unison with the Father and the Son.
Then there are those who hear through the apostles¬ word, so the Lord says, "I do not demand for these
{184}
only, but for those who believe on me through their word". That includes ourselves, for all down the dispensation there are those who have believed through the word of the apostles, whose work is fundamental to the dispensation, as we see from @Revelation 21: 14. So the Lord says, "that they may be all one" -- that is the apostles, and all those who come into the blessing through their word. But then, what a oneness it is! "As thou" -- note the word 'as', we had it in verse 11 -- "may be one *as* we" and now here "*as* thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us" (verse 21). I believe this is oneness of love. It is a very beautiful thought that we are brought into a oneness of love with the Father and the Son; that is the great thought that was before the heart and mind of our beloved Lord. Our hearts are bowed in worship as we ponder over His words and perceive something of what was in His mind! We cannot reach all that was in His mind, but we get an impression of the blessedness of what was before Him in speaking to the Father. How reverently we should read these passages! How reverently we should speak of them, and think of them, that we might, by the blessed Spirit, be helped to enter a little into what was in the mind of the Lord. Think of the desire of His heart that all those who come to Him through the word of the apostles (embracing the whole dispensation in its full thought), may be one, "as thou Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us". And this is a communion of love, to be enjoyed now by the Spirit. Then this is to be testimonial in character, for the Lord says, "that the world may believe". In this aspect it links with what the Lord said in chapter 13, "Children ... a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have
{185}
love among yourselves". It is "as I have loved you", that is to say, the love that was here in Jesus is here today, testimonially. What love shone in the Lord Jesus here in His movements, and in the sphere of testimony, if one might say so reverently, and now His mind is that the same character of love should be continued in persons like ourselves! How it would deepen our desires to be liberated from every hindering cause, that our testimony might flow from the warmth and enjoyment of this precious oneness of love with the Father and the Son.
Then in verse 22 He says "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one as we are one". What great thoughts were in the Lord's mind, and He was going to die in order to secure them. He says "I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it", and though the Lord had not died at that time, the whole chapter is based, in principle, on the work being completed, and that this oneness might exist practically by the Spirit. Thus, that in this present time we have oneness in service, oneness in testimony, oneness in love, oneness in glory, and then, we might add, a oneness which will continue eternally. This oneness in glory is very marvellous and "perfected into one" would carry our minds on to the holy city, coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God. Time does not permit to speak in detail, but it may rest upon our spirits that the Lord Jesus, speaking to the Father should say, "the glory which thou hast given me, I have given them". That glory will shine out in the day to come, in the holy city, having the glory of God, and the glory of Christ. But then, it is to shine out now, the glory is here. It says in @Romans 8, "whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified". That is the position today! Reference has been
{186}
made to the ruling class, they are the glorified class, wonderful thought! We do not want to make anything of it publicly, but that is what the scripture says, and we are given to share the glory; "The glory which thou hast given me, I have given them that they may be one, as we are one".
Then I would touch briefly on the last verse, "I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known". Why? "That the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them". The love wherewith the Father has loved the Son is to be in the saints. How we need to ponder this. It involves the Spirit, the Father's Spirit, as the power by which the love wherewith the Father has loved the Son is to be in us. But how marvellous it is that the Lord should desire this of the Father for us, and that the Father's Spirit should be available, to form, in the souls of the saints, the same character of love for His beloved Son that the Father has Himself. Not in the same fulness, of course, one could never say that, but the same *kind* of love, that we should be brought into communion with the Father in the Father's thoughts of and love for the Son. It is a very wonderful thing, yet it is this of which the Lord speaks. And then the Lord says "and I in them". I believe that that would be the spirit of sonship in the saints, giving affections in the saints akin to those of the Son in relation to the Father. So that we are brought into a wonderful system of reciprocal love. We see the workings of love of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and find ourselves in it, in marvellous grace. We are to have the joy of it in our souls now, and these meetings are all to help us to be more in this. We are coming into the best and the highest and the most wonderful things as a matter of present enjoyment. So, in this last verse, we are in the presence of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These glorious Persons, come before us in such a wonderful
{187}
way, that we can only bow our hearts in adoration. That indeed is the great object of the meetings which we are privileged to be enjoying together, that what comes before us may promote a worshipful spirit, as the light of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, in this wonderful economy of love, shines more brightly before us. Thus we worship together the God who in infinite grace we have thus come to know.

BONDMEN OF GOD AND OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
G. R. Cowell
@Acts 2: 18; @3 John 14; @Revelation 1: 1, 2; @Revelation 10: 7; @Revelation 19: 5 - 7; @Revelation 22: 3 - 5
I wish, dear brethren, as a bondman of Jesus Christ, and as, I trust, His happy slave, to speak a word to my fellow-bondmen with a view to each one of us being *truly* bondmen of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God has great thoughts for men. His great thought for men, as regards relationship is sonship. He has also great thoughts for men as to the dignity He would put upon them through the anointing. We speak of Christ the Prophet, Priest and King. Those offices are involved in the anointing. God would put great dignity upon His saints in the power of the anointing. But the practical enjoyment of our relationship with God, and our coming into the gain of the dignity of the anointing, is dependent upon our accepting our place as bondmen. I do not mean to say that our relationship is conditional; I am speaking of the enjoyment of it. We are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus, and God said of old, "Let my son go, that he may serve me". But if we rightly appreciate God's grace that has given us sonship, we shall delight, as we think of the greatness of the God who has marked us out beforehand for adoption by Jesus Christ to Himself, to hold ourselves as bondmen of God. It is an immense privilege to be the bondmen and bondwomen of *such* a God. The apostles esteemed it so. The five epistle writers, Paul, Peter, James, Jude and John, each calls himself a bondman; and they give this designation precedence over any other. So we have, "Simon Peter,
{189}
bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ", and "Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, a called apostle, separated to God's glad tidings".
Now it is a wonderful thing that the Lord Jesus Himself affords us a great Model on this line, though entirely different from us in the manner of His bondmanship. We were thinking of Him today, as recorded in @Philippians 2: 6, "who, subsisting in the form of God, did not esteem it an object of rapine to be on an equality with God". It was evident when He was here that He did not esteem it an object of rapine to assert His equality with God; but it says. He "emptied himself, taking a bondman's form, taking his place in the likeness of men" and then it goes on "having been found in figure as a man", God has great thoughts of dignity connected with man, and the Lord was found here in figure as a man. Headship, kingship, and priesthood belong to man. But being found in figure as a man, He did not, at that time, claim those official positions, though they are His by right, but He "humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of the cross. Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name that which is above every name". We see Him now as the Priest and King, God's anointed. God bears witness to Him as such. But He, in infinite grace, has reached that position by way of bondman service, becoming obedient even unto death and that the death of the cross. He went into depths which the creature could never fathom; into sufferings which the creature could never have sustained. What a service He did! Think of His bondman service on earth ending in that way. God made Him to be sin for us. Think of Him being *prepared* to go that way in obedience, "Him who knew not sin he has made sin for us, that we might become God's righteousness in him", @2 Corinthians 5: 21. No wonder God has exalted Him! It is an act of
{190}
righteousness on God's part to exalt such a One as that. How could God do otherwise? "Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and granted him a name, that which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to God the Father's glory". How right that is! It is the righteous, moral consequence of His bondman service even unto death, and that the death of the cross.
The taking a bondman's form was His own act. "Once here in the form of a bondman, Thou servedst for wages of love". The Hebrew bondman is a great type. It says, if he came in with his body, he could go out with his body (see footnote to @Exodus 21: 4). But if he said plainly, I love my master, my wife, my children, I will not go out free, then certain consequences were to follow. Thus the Lord Jesus served for wages of love. Love led Him to empty Himself and take a bondman's form; taking His place in the likeness of men to do bondman service; not, at that point, to take up His kingly position, but to do bondman service even unto death, even to the point of being made sin. And so, in His case, it was a matter of His body. He came in with His body, and bondmanship affects *our* bodies. According to Hebrews, as coming into the world He said, "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body" (chapter 10: 5), or "ears hast thou digged", as it says in the footnote to @Psalm 40: 6, referring to the Hebrew bondman who would not go out free and whose ear was therefore bored to the doorpost. And then He adds, "Lo, I come ... to do, O God, thy will", That passage shows that His bondman service had in view that He would offer Himself as the antitype of the offerings of old. "Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; ... thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices
{191}
for sin ... . Then said I, Lo, I come". The offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all, in all that that meant to Him, was the amazing extent to which His bondman service went. He came in with His body and He surrendered His body in the offering of it to God. So that when it says, "I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it", you can see how that work centred, as it were, in the altar of burnt-offering. I am not excluding all that He did in His path of service here, but the great climax was there. The great work He came to do involved the offering of Himself.
All this bears on us, dear brethren, as to our bodies. Bondmanship is a matter of the body and it raises the question as to what we are doing with our bodies. @Romans 6 shows how we become bondmen of God. We are bondmen on different terms from the Lord Jesus; we are bondmen because we have been bought, "Do ye not know ... ye are not your own? for ye have been bought with a price, glorify now then God in your *body*", @1 Corinthians 6: 20. What are we doing with our bodies? If a man buys a slave, he wants the use of that man's body. I would address myself to all my fellow-bondmen and bondwomen. What are we doing with our bodies? How are we using them, how are we adorning them? Are we living on this principle that we are not our own, we are bought with a price? And what a price! The price paid by the One who has marked out the path of bondmanship for us! What a price He paid! The word therefore is, glorify now then God in your body. It is your body that God wants. Man was created in God's image and glory. "Whose is this image and superscription?" the Lord says, as regards the denarius. "They say to him, Caesar's". But man was created in God's image and glory. We are to render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, because God has set up Caesar; we are to understand how far Caesar has rights
{192}
over our bodies. Chapter 12 of Romans, which sets out God's rights over the believer, comes before chapter 13, which speaks of Caesar's rights. And so does chapter 6. In chapter 6 we become bondmen to God. Chapter 12 shows that if we become bondmen we shall have something to present to God as priests. We *are* priests because we have the Spirit; but I am referring to the practical matter of having something to present in a priestly way. @Romans 6 shows how we become bondmen, it is a detailed exercise. We yield ourselves to God, as alive from amongst the dead, and our members instruments of righteousness to God; that is, we have got to think of our bodies member by member. With some of us certain members get out of control, and, with other people, other members get out of control. But in @Romans 6 the body is yielded to God, not exactly as a body, but member by member. Thus we become bondmen to righteousness, as it says, and finally, bondmen to God. God does not expect results like this until His grace has been proved. In @Romans 5 we have access by faith into this favour in which we stand and we boast in hope of the glory of God. We also boast in *God* through our Lord Jesus Christ. And what is the answer? Our members are yielded to God. But then, if our members are yielded, so that we become bondmen of God according to @Romans 6, we are able to serve as priests in @Romans 12. "I beseech you ... brethren, by the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your intelligent service". The word 'service' there is not bondman service but priestly service. We have a body to present to God as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable. How has it come about? Through accepting bondmanship. J.T. used to tell us that the Hebrew bondman of @Exodus 21, viewed as a type of Christ, becomes the high priest of @Exodus 28. It is the way of practical qualification
{193}
for priesthood. So it raises the whole question of our bodies; how we are holding them, how we are clothing them, how we are using them. Man as God's image and glory (@1 Corinthians 11: 7) is responsible to express God. Are there any features of the world about us? We need *divine* adornment if we are to represent God. The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is, in the sight of God, of great price.
This matter, therefore, affects not only brothers but sisters. All are involved in it. That is how the testimony began in @Acts 2. Peter, explaining what had happened, says, "upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy", @Acts 2: 18. I am reading this scripture to show that we come into the gain of the anointing by way of bondmanship. You may say, I wish I had more joy in the Holy Spirit; I wish I were used more by the Spirit in prophecy and praise, and were better fitted to stand here for God in testimony in a kingly way. All those things are connected with the anointing, the prophet, priest and king. You wish you were more in those things? Then look to your bondmanship. Peter speaks of it from the side of grace first, "your sons and your daughters". Does it not touch our hearts that God has poured out of His Spirit upon our sons and our daughters? But from *His* side, the persons He commits Himself to are *His bondmen and His bondwomen*. You may say, I am sure I have the Spirit. I hope indeed that you have the Spirit, because you are not in things vitally at all without the Spirit. But the anointing is not the initial view of the Spirit. If you look at @1 Corinthians 12: 12, 13, the instruction begins with the anointing. "So also is the Christ" (@1 Corinthians 12: 12) refers to the assembly, the anointed vessel. Then it says (verse 13), "For also in the power of one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body". And again, "and have all been given to
{194}
drink of one Spirit". Things are presented thus from the divine side, but, on our side, we come into the gain of the Spirit the other way. We have to learn to drink of one Spirit, to open our inwards to the Spirit, as the Lord says, "Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever". As we open our inwards to the Spirit, we find we are carried along in the current, immersed, and thus in the gain of having been baptised in one Spirit into one body. We find ourselves moving along with the brethren in the great current. This makes way for the grace of the anointing to be upon us and we find we are being used by the Spirit in public service and testimony. That is the way of it on our side. But it begins, as to our state, with our being bondmen and bondwomen. "Upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy".
Now the first great result of being a bondman or a bondwomen is that you prophesy. I am not referring to the gift of prophecy; there were prophets and prophetesses in Scripture; but I am referring to the fact that the saints as a whole, if they are in the gain of the Spirit, have the mind of God. We belong to the prophetic, anointed vessel, the Christ. And so Paul says, "ye can all prophesy one by one". He also says, we have the mind of Christ. The Corinthians ought to have had it, they had it potentially in the Spirit, but they were not in the gain of the Spirit because they had not accepted bondmanship. It is to them he says, "Do ye not know ... ye are not your own? for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your *body*". They were using their bodies wrongly, were grieving the Holy Spirit, and therefore had not, in a practical way, the mind of Christ. But if you have the mind of Christ, you are thinking the thoughts of God, and you can speak of the things of
{195}
God. And that is what the company in @Acts 2 were doing. Men and women were speaking the great things of God. Men and women had the mind of God. The women would be acting in a comely way; they would be speaking normally, no doubt, to other women, although the woman of @John 4 spoke to the men. But the point is "my bondmen and my bondwomen" were there in @Acts 2 and they were prophesying: they had the mind of God. Who does God give His mind to? His bondmen and His bondwomen. How are you using your body? Have you accepted bondmanship? Paul had. He said "I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus", @Galatians 6: 17. Not many of us could say that. But he gloried in it. He had the marks of the stripes he had borne and he viewed them as the brands of Christ's happy slave, which he loved to be. He said, "For the rest let no one trouble me". He as much as said, No one can question the reality of *my* Christianity, "I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus". In *some* degree, you know, there should be that about each of us which marks us off as Christ's happy slaves. Do the people at your office or in the factory or the school, know that you are Christ's happy slave, and that you would not be anything else for a thousand worlds? That is what they ought to know. You bear the mark of it in your body. If I am clothing myself according to the latest fashion, I am not bearing in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus, I pass muster in the world. This is a practical matter. For if you are not prepared for bondmanship, God will never trust you. God never trusts a man who trusts himself, but He also never trusts a man who is not committed in bondmanship. To His bondman He will disclose His mind. So that if you are a bondman you will become a prophet in this sense that you will have the mind of God; and that is one of the greatest things you could possibly aspire to, to
{196}
have the mind of God -- to know God, to know His thoughts, to know His will. I speak to the young people here. Would you not like to know God and to know His thoughts and to understand His will? Then take up your privilege of being happy slaves of Jesus Christ, bondmen of God. "If I were yet pleasing men", the apostle says, "I were not Christ's bondman", @Galatians 1: 10. Give up the idea of pleasing men. O, the bondage, the misery of it! It stands in the way of your spiritual progress. Be a bondman of Jesus Christ. His happy slave -- now to please but One. If the young people take this up, they will get on well spiritually. We want the young men and women to get on well. God has committed Himself to us and He counts upon us to commit ourselves to Him. It is the only right thing to do because we have been bought with a *price*. We are not our own; do not let us think we are our own, think of the price that has been paid. Let brothers and sisters understand that it is their privilege to have the mind of God. God will trust you with His mind if you are trustworthy, and that depends on being a true bondman or bondwoman. So in @Revelation 10: 7 it speaks of the mystery of God being completed "as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets". He makes known His deepest secrets, the mystery of God to His own bondmen. And that brings us to the point of friendship.
We read the word in John's epistle, "The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name". This is not a fellowship within a fellowship, it does not mean special friendships in that sense; but it is a challenge as to whether we are truly in fellowship at the present time, because, if we are, we shall be among the friends. How do we qualify for friendship? The Lord says, "Ye are my friends if ye practise *whatever* I command you". Now such a person is a bondman; a bondman is a man who does whatever he is told to do. He is
{197}
not pleasing men, he is pleasing Christ, "Ye are my friends if ye practise *whatever* I command you". Then He says, "I call you no longer bondmen". The moment you become a true bondman of Christ and are prepared to do whatever He commands you in all your habits of life and service. He will say, "I call you no longer bondmen ... but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you". He will hold nothing back but will disclose every secret. The idea of friend in Scripture is a bosom friend. John was in the bosom of Jesus. He is the great example of a friend. The secrets of the bosom are known to such. And we are to understand who the friends are. I can tell you who the friends are. They are those who are committed to the Lord in bondmanship. They become distinguished, as Paul says of one, "the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow bondman in the Lord" (@Colossians 4: 7), and he names him. "The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name". The whole fellowship in these last days should come into this. There is no thought of anyone being outside of it, but you *may* be outside of it, because if you are not truly a bondman you cannot be a friend. You are outside of divine secrets.
There are great secrets to be communicated. Think of the secret made known to Daniel. He and his friends were men who held their bodies for God. Nebuchadnezzar said of them that they yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God. They were bondmen. But see how wonderfully they were let into the secret of God's ways in government. If you want to know the secret of God's ways in government you must be a bondman and thus become a friend like Abraham, the friend of God. What an obedient man Abraham was! When he was called he obeyed and he commanded his household after him. God trusted that
{198}
man. He said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing? The friends have intelligence as to God's ways in government. But then God has greater things than His ways in government, and that is the mystery, the greatest of all secrets. But the friends of this dispensation understand that. Would you not like to qualify to be among the friends? I like to look round upon the friends, those who know, in some measure, the truth of the mystery, and who understand God's ways in government. These are the two great secrets at the present time. The friends know them and become distinguished in that way. They are known by name. Let us come into this circle of the friends. It says "the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets", @Amos 3: 7.
While prophecy is the first thing mentioned as to the bondmen and bondwomen in @Acts 2, the fact is that, if we are prophets as having the mind of God, we shall be qualified to serve as priests. The gift of the Spirit constitutes us priests, but I am speaking about coming into the service practically. You cannot be a priest intelligently, unless you are a prophet. That is, you need the mind of God if you are to praise and pray aright. How can you praise God intelligently without knowing His mind and will? And how can you pray aright without knowing God's mind and will? The first thing, you see, is to be a bondman; then you will come into the mind of God, you will be among the friends; and thus you will be qualified for your priestly office. The anointing has in view that you should function as a priest and this is the way of qualification. And so it says of Abraham "for he is a prophet, and will pray for thee", @Genesis 20: 7. Who knows how to pray? The prophet. It is the brother or sister who has the mind of God who knows how to pray. I believe the reference to Abraham is the first mention of a prophet in
{199}
Scripture. He had not the gift of prophecy, but he was a prophet because he had the mind of God. God had not hidden from Abraham what He was doing. He was the friend of God and had the mind of God, and God says "for he is a prophet, and will pray for thee". A prophet knows both how to pray and how to praise because he has the mind of God. So you can see how, on this line, we are fitted for the great office conferred upon us as priests of God and of the Christ. We know how to pray and how to praise, and that prepares us for our place in kingship. It says in @Revelation 5: 9 "And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, and made them to our God *kings and priests*". It is by way of bondmanship and by way of having the mind of God, that we can serve acceptably as priests and represent God as kings. The elders in Revelation are distinguished all through as having the mind of God, and they are seen on thrones, round the throne, and on their heads golden crowns. They are kings and priests to God. Each of them has "a harp and golden bowl full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints", @Revelation 4: 4 and @Revelation 5: 8.
But what is in mind is what we are now in a priestly and kingly way. We are a kingly priesthood and, as such, we are not only to serve God intelligently in prayer and praise, but to represent Him, as manifesting the true features of royalty, in our testimony in this world. We have a higher calling and greater power in the Spirit than the power that God has delegated to the authorities in this world. They are set up by God and we are to recognise what rightly belongs to Caesar, but we are above all to recognise what belongs to God; and the God we represent is the God who gives strength to His people. Daniel
{200}
says, wisdom and might are His; and He gives us might, in the Spirit, to represent Him in a kingly way down here.
But in @Revelation 22: 3 - 5 we have the culmination. It says "the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him". The word 'servants' is 'bondmen' (see footnote). Think of the way bondmanship is carried through into the heavenly city! We cannot even say that the Lord Himself does not still take on bondman service at times. It says in @Luke 12: 37 "that he will gird himself ... and coming up will serve them". The word 'service' there is a different word but the girding Himself shows what the glorified Lord would do in love for His own. But then, as to the saints, it is evident that bondmanship is carried through into the heavenly city. His bondmen shall serve Him. The word 'serve' there is priestly service. His *bondmen* shall serve Him as priests. I believe the idea of God as God necessitates the thought of bondmen being carried right through. When we think of God as God, in His majesty and greatness, then, whatever relationship He brings us into, even sonship in the most blessed way, and whatever dignity He confers upon us as kings and priests, what place could we take but that of bondmen? And so "his bondmen shall serve him and they shall see his face; and his name is on their foreheads". That is the mark of the bondmen. Let His name be on our foreheads now, let us move about in this world, having the evidence upon us of divine ownership, the evidence that we are the happy slaves of Jesus Christ and of God. Then we shall have liberty to serve Him now as priests; His bondmen will serve Him, and they will see His face. You would like to see His face? These are the people who see His face! And it goes on to say "they shall reign to the ages of ages". The bondmen are both priests and kings, but they
{201}
are still bondmen, they love to be, they love to recognise God's complete rights over them.
So I come back for a moment to chapter 19. A voice came out of the throne in verse 5, and I believe it is the voice to us tonight, *the voice from the throne*. There is much about the throne in Revelation. It stands related to the temple in this book. Isaiah saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple, and one seraphim called to the other saying, "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" And here there is a voice out of the throne. Are not you going to obey the voice from the throne? A voice came out of the throne, saying "*Praise our God*, *all ye his bondmen*". I look round this hall tonight, and I address my brethren in this way, "*all ye his bondmen*". You have been bought with a price, you are not your own, and the throne is speaking to you, and what is it saying? "Praise our God, all ye his *bondmen*, and ye that fear him, small and great". Soon the beast is coming and it says of him that both small and great have to have *his* mark upon their forehead or upon their hand. Thank God it is *God's* mark that is upon us. Let it be so, dear brethren; let us have in our body, in some way, the indication of divine ownership; let *His* mark be upon us. And if we really surrender to God in this way as bondmen, there will be no lack of praise. We shall understand the throne, we shall understand the thoughts of God and we shall respond at once to this voice, "Praise our God, all ye his bondmen, and ye that fear him, small and great". Who would not be in this note of praise? There is an immediate response: "And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, *Hallelujah*". Four hallelujahs occur in this passage. Hallelujah, though a hackneyed term in Christendom, is one of the
{202}
greatest notes of praise. Praise ye Jah, the great self-existent God! It is praise to *God, God as God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit*. For this title applies to Jesus. The first three verses of John's gospel assert who He is; He is the great self-existent One. He always was, and all things began to be through Him. He is Jah, the great I AM. I AM is His own assertion of it, our answer is, "Praise ye Jah". How wonderful to hail the Saviour in this way. Jesus our Saviour is the great self-existent One, co-equal with the Father and with the Holy Spirit. And we would say tonight, "Praise our God, all ye his bondmen". And there is the answer, "Hallelujah, for the Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power. Let us rejoice and exult, and give him glory; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready" -- the great consummation of the mystery.
May we all be caught up in this note of praise tonight. I would say again, "Praise our God all ye his bondmen". I call upon my brethren, and myself more than any, to be true in this matter of bondmanship. May the Lord help us for His Name's sake.
{203}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (1)
@Revelation 22: 16, 17; @Revelation 3: 7 - 13
S.McC. It is in mind to consider the glory of Christ, and how it is to affect the assembly on the eve of the rapture. In the type of old, in Rebecca (@Genesis 24), that well-known section, the journey leads to the point where Rebecca says, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master!" (verse 65), and that is largely what is in mind to take account of, with the desire that there may be the corresponding result with us seen in Rebecca at that juncture as affected by the word, "she took the veil, and covered herself". I think the brethren would readily see that the whole bearing of the Lord's voice at the moment is to detach us from the world and all that is linked with it in view of the apostasy that is coming in, when the world will set up a rival head to Christ. As the product of the Spirit's faithful service, the assembly will admit of no rival to Christ, and we are to see to it that in our hearts no rival to Christ is in any sense made room for; so that it is very affecting to see how the "I Jesus", the emphatic 'I', Jesus, comes into the passage read (verse 16), and "*I* am the root and offspring of David, the bright and morning star". There is a sort of awakening appeal in the fresh touch as to the personal glory of Jesus as this book finishes; a book that is very full in regard to history, involving localities, the assembly generally, and involving the world, but the personal appeal to the saints in this verse at the end is very affecting. It is as if the Lord would understand that there would be an immediate response to this affecting word, and we know that all ministry, rightly speaking according to God, has in mind that Christ personally
{204}
should acquire a place in the affections of the saints, and that there should be a fresh and living response to that Person, and one thing that should be kept in mind, amongst other things, is the way that David comes in, because I think the peculiar way in which David comes into both these passages, refers to what we have already said, that God will permit no rival to Christ. In the Old Testament God would permit no rival to David. Every rival to David must go down. Although the sorrows of the testimony were many in relation to the working out of that great ideal in God's anointed one in David, just as in our time and these last days of the dispensation in the recovery and the revival of the truth there have been many sorrows since the beginning of the recovery, but we can see how Christ comes into the ascendency all the time, with a view to His full place in the affections of the assembly.
C.W.O'L.M. Might I ask who is referred to when the Lord Jesus says, "I Jesus have sent mine angel"?
S.McC. I think the angel alludes to the peculiar setting of the book, that is, the book being of a judicial character, introduces the thought of distance from beginning to end, but yet in the midst of it all there are these personal touches; while there is the recognition of the distance, there are the personal touches of Christ, such as here and to Philadelphia.
A.J.G. Would you say that the fact that these things are testified in the assemblies has in mind that there should be a response to them in every locality?
S.McC. That is what I thought, and David particularly bringing in the thought of unification. In David we have one who was able to unite all Israel and Judah in responsive movement of affection towards himself, so that he was not only crowned at Hebron, but he was given his due place in Jerusalem. I thought that the mention of David links with the
{205}
thought of the unification of the saints universally in regard to this thought of responsive movement to Christ. Would you think that?
A.J.G. I think that helps very much.
P.H.H. So that all the tribes came to Hebron and said to David, "Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh" (@2 Samuel 5: 1), not now Judah only, but the whole people.
S.McC. Exactly, showing what personal attractiveness and power there was in David. God's appointed one, to rally the affections of the brethren and unify them together in the recognition, not only of his personal worth and attractiveness, but God's ordered thought in relation to His king, His anointed.
D.J.H. Does it not say that David became continually greater, but the house of Saul was weakened?
S.McC. Yes, what heart-searchings there were in Israel in the arrival at the supremacy of David. We can see that in the historical books in the Old Testament. If Christ is to acquire the place of supremacy on the eve of translation that this book shows He desires to have, it must of necessity produce heart-searchings with us, because both the letter to Philadelphia and the portion that we have read, emphasise that we are on the eve of the rapture, "I come quickly" is a special word to Philadelphia amongst the assemblies.
J.T.S. Is the ministry calculated to effect what is said in @Acts 13, "And having removed him he raised up to them David" (verse 22)? Is one man to be removed from our hearts and minds, and the other Man in place there -- more than a Man indeed, God's Man?
S.McC. Yes, so that all through the prophets there are such choice allusions to David, not only to David personally, but to the system of David, pointing on as it does to Christ and His renown, as in @Amos 9: 11, God raising up the tabernacle of David,
{206}
and the wonderful results that stand related thereto; just preceding that we get the thought of the sieve, and Israel being shaken in the sieve, yet not the least grain falling to the ground; an abstract allusion that we always have to hold to when we come to that side, but it is making way for the renown of Christ, typified in David and the system that Christ's glory is apprehended in relation to, and especially where the service of God is to have such a choice place.
R.H.S. What is the thought of "the bright and morning star" in relation to David?
S.McC. Well, it is very striking how we get this reference. We get two references to the morning star in this book, the first to Thyatira, then here, but in this verse we get the addition of the word 'bright' that we do not have in Thyatira. Thyatira bringing in, as it does, the introduction of a rival head to Christ in the ecclesiastical order and unity publicly where such corruption has set in as evidenced on every hand, it is striking how the morning star comes in in the darkness linked with that corruption, but here it is linked with the thought of what is bright, as if our hearts and minds are to be illumined by Christ coming on to the horizon of our view in this heavenly way. I think it is detaching, "the bright and morning star" has a detaching effect, drawing us out of the order of things upon which impending judgment is soon to fall, drawing us into that heavenly order of things where Christ is so wondrously supreme.
A.H. Is the thought of the morning star something peculiar that is presented to the assembly?
S.McC. Yes, you do not find it exactly in the prophetic writings. We get the thought of the Sun of righteousness arising with healing in his wings, but "the bright and morning star" seems to be an allusion special to the assembly period and time, therefore I think it bears on this great thought of
{207}
detachment. In all the exercises that are constantly coming up amongst us as to the world and the things of the world, the Lord has in mind our detachment from the world, so that as the rapture takes place we have not much to hold us here.
E.C.M. Does Peter help when he refers to "the prophetic word made surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until the day dawn and the morning star arise in your hearts", @2 Peter 1: 19? I was thinking of the link with the prophetic word.
S.McC. Yes, Peter in that way would link on with what we are saying, especially as we think of the allusion that has just been made by Peter before these verses to "the excellent glory" (verse 17), and how Christ is brought on to our view on the holy mount, signalised as He is by the Father's salutation.
C.M.M. You spoke of the rapture; is there a sense in which we hold the coming of Christ as one great whole, the rapture and His appearing, in the longings of the assembly?
S.McC. I think so, in fact you would say the appearing is really more prominent here than the rapture, it involves the rapture, but the appearing would be in mind here in full result.
F.P.M.G. Does Abigail illustrate this detachment of which you are speaking in her judgment, both of Nabal and of Saul, and has David some suggestion of the bright and morning star to her, she speaks of all the good which Jehovah will do?
S.McC. Yes, that is a good reference, especially as it comes in following the death of Samuel, showing what the prophetic ministry had resulted in, and that is what is coming out at the present moment; what there is in a substantial way in the saints, that while publicly linked with an order of things ecclesiastically where there is not much appreciation of Christ as typified in David, for that would be what it would
{208}
suggest, Abigail substantially sets out the result of the ministry, and the assembly is to set out substantially, as it were, the result of all that has so richly come to us from the days of the recovery.
S.H.N. Would the thought of grace come out with David? You referred in your prayer to the thought of recovery, and I was thinking of the grace that came out for example towards Mephibosheth, in showing the kindness of God towards him.
S.McC. What you find with David so remarkably, is the effectiveness of administration; grace is prominent with him, and righteousness too. You find that comes to light in his word to Solomon, how everything was carefully measured by David.
A.H.G. Would you say a little more as to what you have in mind as to David's system?
S.McC. I think it points to what is linked with Christ in the type in that sense, in which his renown is seen. Where would you see the renown of Christ today? Certainly you do not see it in Israel, you do not see it in the world, you see it in the assembly. That is the realm in which the renown of Christ appears, and the assembly in that way is always to be in our thoughts, however dark and difficult the day may be.
A.J.G. You were connecting it, were you not, with the expression, "the tabernacle of David" in Amos?
S.McC. Yes. It is over against the ruin and the breakdown, it is what God raises up and the fruitful results and conditions that flow from that. The tabernacle of David would stand over against all independency in sects and schismatic parties.
P.H.H. Are the thoughts of the root and the offspring only correctly understood in the assembly?
S.McC. I would say so, and these are very affecting allusions, the root of David reminding us of the Lord's greatness, His deity; the offspring of David
{209}
reminding us so forcibly of His humanity. It is very affecting that the Lord is the *root* of David. You can understand how so much can be said about David in the Old Testament, although he was a man like ourselves, so much could be said about him in the light of this verse, that the Lord was the root of David.
P.H.H. Does all that bear upon the new day? The bright and morning star ushers in the new day, does it? Is the light of the deity of Christ and the manhood of Christ all enriching us to go into the new day?
S.McC. Yes, and especially helping us and steadying us over against the departure from the truth on every hand. Think of the error as to the Person of Christ on every hand about which we are not to think lightly. It is to affect us, and the Lord's word here would be over against all the departure from the truth in regard to His Person, "I am the root and offspring of David".
C.W.O'L.M. Do the last words of David bear on this at all, "the morning without clouds" and so on? @2 Samuel 23: 4.
S.McC. Yes, it would, it has in mind the true administration according to God coming in, as it will come in at the appearing of Christ, and we are going to be with Him. He is not going to come out without us. Therefore the need of being clear in regard to all matters now in view of coming out with Him then, in the glory of that day and the blest administration of it in which we shall have part with Christ.
M.D.S. Is that why in verse 12 He would say, "Behold, I come quickly", and then He goes on to say, "Blessed are they that wash their robes", putting that exercise upon every one of us in the light of what you are saying?
S.McC. Yes, it is very striking that preceding verses 16 and 17 are these verses 14 and 15, bringing on to
{210}
our view the moral way in which we are cleared and detached from all that is extraneous in regard to our robes, so that we should have right to these glorious matters that the tree of life and the city open up.
E.J.H. Is that seen too in Abigail, so near one physically and yet morally and spiritually she was completely detached from Nabal and wholly attached to David?
S.McC. Yes, therefore it is a very testing matter in our position in the world, being so near to it as we are physically yet we need to be so far apart from it morally, in spirit and in ways. I think the Lord is stressing that, and what better expulsive power in our hearts in regard to extraneous influences could there be than the powerful presentation of His personal glory as here, "I Jesus". What a moving appeal in regard to our detachment from the world and our readiness to meet Him and greet Him in the air, as we shall!
R.G.B. In John's gospel, written for the last days and presenting peculiarly the glory of the Person of Christ, do the closing chapters present to us peculiarly the withdrawal and the impelling of the saints out of the world?
S.McC. Very much so, as in @John 17, for instance, the Lord stresses, "They are not of the world, as I am not of the world" (verse 16). What a detaching sense that imparts to us as we take account of our position here in the world, yet not of it, and this is to enter into every department of life, not only entering into matters of the assembly, but entering into our homes, our businesses, our work, so that there is a testimony, as it were, to our detachment in mind and spirit from the world, which is hastening on to the appointing of the rival head.
J.T.S. Is it not affecting that in the beginning of John's gospel it says, "The world knew him not" @John 1: 10? In his epistle he says, "The world
{211}
knows us not, because it knew him not" (@1 John 3: 1), a people apart from it because of their attachment to Christ.
S.McC. Just so.
J.W.D. Is it not thought that in the assembly there is the greatest expression of intelligence in regard to the Lord's deity and manhood? I was thinking of the bearing of it upon what you were saying about preservation from the world and the earth.
S.McC. In that sense there is no other creature so near to Deity as the assembly.
S.E.W. Would you say something about this testimony being *in* the assembly, the 16th verse of chapter 22?
S.McC. It shows how the Lord is thinking of the local assemblies, the local gatherings, it is the plural, "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify these things to you in the assemblies", showing how the local positions are in His mind all the way through. The book opens with a review of the local positions, and it ends with an appeal to the local positions.
W.M.B. Does that merge in the universal thought in verse 17 where we have the Spirit and the bride?
S.McC. Yes, that is the bride brings in the great thought of femininity for the heart of Christ, which would bring on to our view the great universal thought, so that the two thoughts are together in verses 16 and 17, the economy of local assemblies, the local thought in verse 16 and then the great catholic thought in verse 17, the bride.
R.H.S. Would the thought of "to you in the assemblies" have any suggestion of every one of the personnel of local assemblies?
S.McC. I think it would. The Lord would have that in mind, therefore it would bring up with us as to where we stand in regard to the testimony to these things, personally.
{212}
A.H. How far do you think we should carry this matter of the bride? Would that cover the whole of the saints on earth, or would it have to be limited to those who have the light of the assembly in any way?
S.McC. I think the Lord would help us in the book of the Revelation to have full assembly thoughts in mind. That is we would not have anything less than the whole thought of the assembly in mind, whether it may be seen in few or many; that is another matter, but the bride would represent the character of the assembly in the eyes of Christ, that He is thinking about her as we shall see in Philadelphia. After all, the power and effectiveness of the number of any persons, believers, is not linked with the truth that they hold, as F.E.R. pointed out; it is linked with how they stand in the truth of the assembly.
A.H. You think in that way that although the @2 Timothy 2 position publicly obtains right to the end, we must hold to it that the bride represents a whole thought?
S.McC. I think that is what it has in mind. Mr. Raven, you will recall, pointed out in the lecture on "The Holy City" in Volume 2 of his lectures, that John saw what Paul never saw; while John had no distinctive commission like Paul and Peter, yet he saw what Paul never saw, what Peter never saw. The Lord gave John to see, in the letter and the word to Philadelphia, what it was to take account of persons standing through revival in the truth of the assembly, that there is a revived state of things, not altogether prophetic, but it was there in Philadelphia.
A.J.G. And Mr. Taylor has stressed, has he not, that "I have loved thee" in Philadelphia is nothing less than the whole assembly?
S.McC. The Lord has in mind the whole thought, and the bride here would include the whole thought, and we should never hold anything less in our minds, in that sense, than the whole thought.
{213}
P.H.H. Should we not allow for God to do much in the last moments of the dispensation in that way, so that the whole bride, the whole assembly thought, may occur perhaps to many, for the first time, just before the Lord comes?
S.McC. In that way we cannot limit what God can do, but even now in conditions of public weakness as we are in, in days of recovery and revival, we should not hold anything less in our outlook than what the Lord holds, namely, the assembly.
C.M.M. Would the evangelical 'come' brought in here, have a bearing on the completion of the bride?
S.McC. I would think it would have. It is a question now of those who may be laggardly in the matter, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take the water of life freely". It is as if we would desire that not one should be missed out; we know that no one will be missed out who rightly belongs to the Lord, but it is the desire of our hearts practically as in the current of this, linked with the Spirit, that none should be missed out.
F.P.S. Is that why David is set out as a shepherd in a peculiar way, "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David" (@Ezekiel 34: 23); there will be no sheep missing?
S.McC. Just so.
M.H.T. Is it significant that the tense used in verse 17 is the present? They *say*, Come; it is not, *will* say, Come. In that way is it suggestive that that has always been characteristically the language of the bride from the very beginning?
S.McC. Well, it is very interesting in that way to see how the present tense is used, "the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come"; that is the
{214}
conditions are present to the one who is speaking here.
P.H.H. Would you say a little more about "the Spirit and the bride"?
S.McC. I think it is very affecting the way that the Spirit is linked with the bride here, and the bride is linked with the Spirit. We have a divine Person, *the* Spirit, it is a peculiar reference to Himself personally in His own uniqueness, "the Spirit", and "the bride", is a reference to the assembly and her uniqueness and distinctiveness. But we have a divine Person, and we have a creature in the thought of the bride linked together in response to this word of the Lord Jesus saying "Come".
D.J.H. Why is it we get the thought of the saying first, and the doing afterwards? At the beginning of verse 17, "And the Spirit and the bride *say*, Come. And let him that hears say, Come", and then it is a matter of doing something, "And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him *take* the water of life freely".
S.McC. The whole thing is based on appeal, it is not a matter of force, it is not a matter of pushing persons into the position where the water of life is, it involves movement. The water of life is available, but then it involves movement, that is, as it says, "let him that is athirst *come*"; come where? Come where the water of life is. It shows that the water of life is not everywhere in that sense. As the early ministry of J.T. pointed out in regard to @John 4, the living water is located, so that it involves movement.
D.J.H. Would it be in a certain sense light first, the light of the position in the saying and then the response to that as you have been stressing in the coming?
S.McC. I would say that, that is it is like the glad tidings going out and the ministry, and then the results would come to light involving detachment;
{215}
detachment from associations, religious or otherwise, or detachment from the world in any shape or form, would be involved in the coming; we have to leave one set of circumstances to come into another set of circumstances where the water of life is flowing.
L.G.B. Would locating the living water involve that the truth of the gospel is not divorced from the truth of the assembly?
S.McC. Well, it would, and we want to see the importance of that so that the assembly is not left out of the gospel for the two are bound up together in that sense.
E.J.B. With regard to what you were saying about "the Spirit", is it striking that both the passages you have read use the title "the Spirit", and in each case it follows a very glorious presentation of Christ? Is He the One who is able to bring the richest thoughts of Christ to the assembly?
S.McC. I would say so, so that in all the words to the overcomer, the word is "let him hear what *the* Spirit says". It is not what the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Christ says, not even is the adjective 'holy' attached, it is "let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies", as if the personal distinctiveness and greatness of the Spirit are involved in the matter of the truth, and what works out in our detachment from all that is extraneous in view of being for Christ as Philadelphia sets out -- as we should now come to it.
A.J.G. Is there not something peculiarly affecting in verse 17 in that in the main the Spirit is speaking to the saints on Christ's behalf, but now in verse 17 He is with the bride, speaking to the Lord?
S.McC. It is very affecting to think of one divine Person addressing Another, and linked with it is the creature entity in the bride, the refined and glorious product of the Spirit's personal service and His mission here.
{216}
A.H. Is it right to think that this remarkable appeal in these verses, 16 and 17, has in mind the believer carrying out the injunction of verse 14 to which we have already referred? Is that what you have in mind when you speak of detachment?
S.McC. That is it, it is a question of the realm, going into the city; well, the water of life flows freely there as we are shown at the beginning of the book, and this 17th verse ought to encourage the Trustees of the Depot in regard to what is in mind in connection with the publication of the gospel preachings. All that is, I think, apropos to the moment as we are on the eve of the Lord's coming, the great desire evangelically to reach one and all. Not only the unsaved, but the saints are to be affected by the gospel.
A.H.G. Would there be a link between the tree of life in verse 14 and the water of life later on?
S.McC. The tree of life is a central thought, in one sense, a static thought, that is it is in the midst of the paradise of God, whereas the water of life is a flowing thought, it is what flows. The tree of life is Christ objectively apprehended, of course; the water of life points to the Spirit.
F.C.M. Is it delightful then to see the effective result of the presentation of "I Jesus", the result Christ-ward in the Spirit and the bride, and the result in powerful testimony man-ward?
S.McC. That brings up where we are, what can we say about it? Has the personal glory of Christ affected our hearts in the same way so that there is this holy fervency and desire on this line that need might be met?
A.C.S.P. Does the climax of the recovery under Nehemiah bear on what you are saying? After the rebuilding of the wall and the establishment of the choirs, we get the unique references to David and the prominence he had; you have the city of David,
{217}
and the house of David, and the instruments of David, the commandments of David and the days of David, all crowded into one short section.
S.McC. That is very interesting because following these particular references it says at the climax of the movement of the first choir that "they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water-gate eastward" (@Nehemiah 12: 37), showing how much is made of David, and how much is made of the fountain-gate and the water-gate in the climax of the movement. In Philadelphia the glory of Christ comes on to our view in a peculiar way, and I think what affects Christ so much in Philadelphia is that His glory is so appreciated, as it apparently is by what the Lord says, so that He can disclose Himself and the secrets of His heart as Man, in a peculiar way to what so choicely appreciates what He is in His personal glory.
A.H. Do you think the great feature of His glory is "the key of David", as perhaps suggesting the way He opens the door into the service of God?
S.McC. I do, and in regard to the rich administration that characterised David's regime, especially the prominence that grace assumed in it, all that would be in mind as an entrance into the best according to divine thoughts, and one particular thought that was in one's mind in "my new name". I believe, as the time is so short, that it is important that we should see that that has a detaching effect on the assembly, on the saints. The apprehension of Christ's new name only but consolidates the detachment in their souls from the ecclesiastical order and unity which has become a hot-bed of corruption in the public scene around us.
A.W.P. You have mentioned detachment two or three times, the apostle Paul, in @2 Timothy 2, links on the glad tidings with David: "Jesus Christ raised from among the dead, of the seed of David,
{218}
according to my glad tidings". Does that link on with what you have in mind?
S.McC. Well, it does. The truth of the glad tidings involves the presentation of Christ on that line, especially in detachment in regard to moral matters.
P.H.H. Were you suggesting that the new name in one department of its meaning, stands over against religious antiquity and stagnation? Do you also think that it has a point of substantial meaning of its own? What would you say it was?
S.McC. I think the maintenance of that and the apprehension of it in our souls, brings about the incidental side on the negative line, our detachment from things around, but the main thought would be what the apprehension of it is on the positive line. I think it particularly alludes, of course, to the position He has come into in humanity and especially involving the glorified state, and bearing upon the whole matter of the service of God, in such a distinctive way, so that these rich thoughts are linked with it, "the temple of my God", and "the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem". It seems to one that the mention of the new name in that cluster of glories is to show the uniqueness of Christ in His humanity in this new relation; standing related to all that is so choice and so great in that connection.
A.J.G. Christ in His humanity in relation to His God.
S.McC. That is it.
P.H.H. Therefore does @John 20 enter into it a bit, where it is a question of His humanity and His sonship, and yet saying, "I ascend to my Father ... and to my God" (@John 20: 17), would all that enter into the setting of "my new name"?
S.McC. I think it would. I think the word 'I ascend' particularly is to affect us in regard to this
{219}
way that leads into the apprehension of the new name, what Christ is in the glory of His humanity, in its present glorious state, not exactly as seen in the gospels, but in its present glorious state, standing related to God in these wonderful relations. What a wonderful thing it is that manhood is before God in the uniqueness of these relations.
W.M.B. Would there be any link with the glory which the Lord asked the Father that we might behold, "my glory which thou hast given me", @John 17: 24?
S.McC. I think there is a definite link, we are not said to participate in it, or have part in it, but the thought of the contemplation of it is in mind, and here it is very strong. He says, "I will write upon him", that is some impression is made of lasting permanent value in the writing in regard to humanity in this new way as seen in Christ before God.
A.J.G. So that does the overcomer, as having the name of Christ's God written upon Him and then Christ's new name written upon Him, have a great appreciation of what God is to Christ, and then of what Christ is to God? I mean, is it as the Lord says, "My God, and your God", apprehended by the overcomer, and become in a sense, characteristic of him, and then the answer to it in what Christ is to His God?
S.McC. I think that is right, what that must be to God and how it is to affect the overcomer, so that there is spiritual stability in the position, while we may be ostracized from all the associations and affiliations around, the overcomer is contemplated as a pillar in the temple of Christ's God. Think of a pillar in that order of things where God is so blessedly known!
E.J.H. Is there thus what one might speak of as the communication of abiding renown on such a person, as the name is mentioned so many times?
{220}
S.McC. I think there is, and I think the verse too involves what was said earlier, that there is peculiar capacity in the assembly to take in thoughts of God, in so far as the creature mind and understanding can take them in, but the Lord seems to have great delight in speaking to Philadelphia in this way and to the overcomer, bearing in mind what His God was to Him. Our God is not exactly mentioned here, we include our God in @John 20, but it is not *our* God exactly in @Revelation 3, it is the uniqueness of Christ's humanity and what God was to Him, and what He was to God, and the new name enters into this.
A.H.G. Would there be any link at all between this and the thought of new Jerusalem?
S.McC. I think there would, that is it is what is distinctive, what has not existed before, what stands out in all its uniqueness, *the* new Jerusalem, not *a* new Jerusalem. It might have said *a* new Jerusalem, but the point is it is the eternal side, and new in the sense of what never has existed before, "*the* new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven, from my God", notice the emphasis on "from my God", not only what God is in relation to Christ personally, but what God is in relation to the city, new Jerusalem.
P.H.H. Does not that reference to the new Jerusalem coming down suggest that we are very near to the glory and eternity?
S.McC. That is what I thought and it is all to detach us from this world. The powerful ministry of J.T. in recent years, amidst human frailty, was ordered of the Lord, all in view of this detaching line, that we might be detached from all that is negative, that would mar the distinctiveness of the heavenly glory of the assembly.
A.H. So the Lord says, "I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an opened door", would you think as making use of that door and freeing ourselves, this is what we arrive at?
{221}
S.McC. So that we want to see what is in the body of the letter in that way to Philadelphia. It is the acceptance of death to the world, complete dissociation from all that there is in the world in that sense; not that we go out of the world, the brethren understand that, but in spirit and in ways, there would be complete detachment in view of our links with Christ, and the apprehension and appreciation of His glory.
A.A.L. Would the epistle to the Hebrews open out the thought of the new name a little?
S.McC. Yes, we will take up that this afternoon. "I come quickly; hold fast what thou hast, that no one take thy crown". I think the crown alludes to the way that the Person of Christ has come before us in the powerful ministry of the recovery, and He is enshrined in the affections of the saints, so that we hold fast to that and we are not going to be turned from it.
W.McK. Does the idea of the pillar imply that the overcomer becomes an integral part of this system where these glories are shining? He has been detached, but there is no idea of detachment in this system now; he is an integral part of it.
S.McC. Yes, that is, he is in perfect consistency with the whole order of things indicated in it, especially the revelation of God in Christ which the temple of God alludes to.
R.H.S. Does the thought of "He that overcomes" involve the thought of continuity? It is not just 'has overcome', but "He that overcomes".
S.McC. That is it, we must be on that line all the time, it is characteristic.
{222}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (2)
@Hebrews 2: 9 - 13; @Hebrews 7: 23 - 28; @Hebrews 8: 1, 2; @Hebrews 10: 19 - 25
S.McC. The presentation of the glory of Christ in this letter to the Hebrew Christians, has in mind very specially their detachment from Judaism which had such a great place in the ways of God, being the highest dispensed form of government in the ways of God. The writer no doubt by external and internal evidences, is thought to be Paul, though we are not told actually that it was Paul, but the style seems to be Paul's, so that we can see how the heavenly side has such a place in this epistle. The great strength and stability of the system takes character from Christ and all is made to hang on Him, because of who He is. In this epistle we not only have His humanity wondrously projected on to our view, but we also have His deity, linking on with what we had in "the root and offspring of David", and there is a certain analogy in the letter, and the writing of it, to ourselves and our own position, in that the overthrow of the world's system is imminent, as was the overthrow of Jerusalem when this letter was written. It is generally thought that the letter was 67 A.D. and the overthrow was 70 A.D., and the letter has in mind the extrication of the believers from the system here below which so held and affected them. No doubt there was, as the letter would show, a certain falling away with some and a certain, perhaps, discouragement with others, and the presentation of the glory of Christ in the letter has in mind powerfully to affect them and draw them out of that in which there was a tendency to be held. In these passages which we have read we have reference to the Lord Jesus in different ways. "The leader of their salvation" is a very fine reference to Christ in this exalted setting,
{223}
bringing in how great the salvation of the many sons is, involving, as it does, the divine pleasure and the divine praise, and then we have reference in the second section that we read, to the High Priest, His exalted character, and the exalted character of the saints and their heavenly calling, so that such a High Priest became them, and then the minister of the holy place, or the minister of the sanctuary. These are very fine references to Christ, calculated to affect our souls, drawing them out of things here and into the vast universal scene of glory where He is the Centre and God is known so blessedly. Then we have the last reference to the great Priest, and drawing near, especially in view of the day approaching, that is the consummation of things that we have had before us. The first chapter draws attention to the glory of Christ in His deity, but here we come to what affects our souls in reference to His humanity, "But now we see not yet all things subjected to him, but we see Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour". The epistle opens up the great realm in which Jesus is, so scornfully and ignominiously treated at Calvary, bruised and spat upon by the leaders of Judaism, but now in the scene of glory above, saluted by God as the hymn says, "The Father's greetings -- honours rare -- are heaped upon His Son's blest brow" (`350:2). He is well worthy of them.
A.H. Would you add a word with regard to your reference to the exalted character of our salvation?
S.McC. I thought the setting of it here involved the part and place we have in the great thought of sonship, "bringing many sons to glory"; first of all "it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things", an allusion to God in the relation in which He comes on to our view. I think it particularly links with John's presentation of God
{224}
in the thought of the Father, with whom the "all things" are linked all the way through the gospel of John. Sonship is in mind, first in Christ, of course, seen so specially, and then by implication in the saints, so that our salvation involves the thought of glory and then we have the thought of the brethren of Christ in verse 11, and the praise of God in verse 12.
M.H.T. Do you think that Stephen would be a good example of one who set forward this matter at the beginning when he bears testimony to the fact that he saw the heavens opened through, and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God?
S.McC. Yes, I suppose Stephen in the setting there would link with the epistle to the Hebrews, the thought of the opened heavens would enter into this letter. Stephen is not under the power of the circumstances, he is detached from them in spirit.
P.H.H. Is the divine speaking according to the beginning of the epistle, "God having spoken in ... Son" to present the attractiveness of the speaking that it should be in such a setting? Mr. Darby's note 'c', the latter part of it, "It is God himself who speaks; not by another; not as the Father nor in the Person of the Father; not merely by the Holy Spirit, but as himself a divine Person, and that Person the Son". Does that make the Sonship of Christ, in that setting, a very peculiarly attractive and pleasurable presentation of His Person?
S.McC. Well, it does and shows how closely the thought of His deity is linked with His Sonship, that while His Sonship alludes to His place in humanity, yet linked with it is the powerful reference to the Person, and who He is, and the character of the speaking here would be in contrast to all that has gone before, and, rather than in comparison, it would stand out in contrast to the speaking before, the elevated, exalted character of the expression of God that this letter opens with.
{225}
P.H.H. Does that character of sonship more or less pervade the epistle?
S.McC. It does, so that in the matter of His priesthood, and His installation in the priestly office on high, His sonship is brought into the subject, and we see how His priesthood is based upon His sonship, but it is also based upon His eternal personality, like we have the interlacing of the gold in @Exodus 28 and 29 in the priestly garments par excellence so we have the interweaving of these great thoughts in regard to Christ's priesthood in this letter.
P.H.H. So if we are speaking about the sonship of the saints, while, of course, He in His Person, is unique, yet does He, in a sense, make the standard of the sonship of the saints? God bringing many sons to glory, are they extremely dignified persons?
S.McC. They are. That a divine Person should have come into the relationship of Son, as viewed in this letter, to bring out the great thought, of not what God is arbitrarily exactly in the exercise of His power, but what He is in His nature in the opening out of His heart, is a very wonderful matter. While sonship was placed in the human family at the outset, yet it looked on to the Incarnation, and to the greatness of the moment when a divine Person would come into that relation, and it would be seen in a way in which it was never seen before.
A.J.G. And now seen in its final form in Christ in glory?
S.McC. Exactly; the word 'perfect' is interesting in that relation. It would bear now on the great thought in glory that He has reached in manhood, a position and state, which is according to God's purpose for man.
C.M.M. Would the glory of Christ in chapters 1 and 2, "the root and offspring", help as to an understanding of His mediatorial position, Mediator of God and man?
{226}
S.McC. It would very much because the new name would embrace, as was referred to this morning, the renown linked with the great fact that not only do we see Man perfectly in Him towards God, but we also see God perfectly in Him towards man. In the mediatorial realm out of which we never go, Christ is apprehended according to the renown that stands related to these great things.
A.J.G. So that the gospel of John was written so that we might "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name", @John 20: 31. Does that bring in the thought of a great realm filled with the renown of Christ in which we find our life?
S.McC. That is the point. John would, in his ministry, greatly impress us with that, the great realm in which Christ in His mediatorial glory stands out so uniquely and as linked with and attached to Him in that realm, we find our life, indeed He is said to be our life, life is in Him, of course, but He is said to *be* our life.
P.H.H. Would you say another word about the word translated 'leader', "to make perfect the leader of their salvation". It is referred to elsewhere as we know -- what is the precise setting of it?
S.McC. The note in @Acts 3 helps as to the literal meaning of the word. It says, "This word is difficult to render in English. It is a 'leader', but it is more. It is used for one who begins and sets a matter on". That is very fine in regard to the context in @Hebrews 2, we get it again in @Hebrews 12, it means He began and finished the whole course. I think it helps us as to this matter of sonship, the leader of our salvation in this relation. He began the matter and has set it on; so John's gospel helps us as to that.
P.H.H. Is the matter which He sets on all the greater on account of His Person?
S.McC. I thought so. We have heard @John 17
{227}
alluded to in the sense that we are in the presence of the Minister of the sanctuary, but it affects us to think too we are in the presence of the Leader of our salvation. The many sons who are being brought to glory, "the leader of their salvation" is speaking to the Father, speaking to God in the way in which He is known in the parental relation in John's gospel, and He is speaking about their salvation. He begins with the thought of eternal life, and He ends with the thought of sonship, that is that we might be with Him where He is.
A.H. In view of all that, is not there something very touching in that reference, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things"?
S.McC. I think there is. The "all things" are very interesting in that light. You notice how full the subject is in John's gospel as God comes on to our view in the paternal relation in that gospel, the all things are constantly referred to in relation to Him, but then it says, "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in his hand" (@John 3: 35), that is the Mediator comes on to our view in the mediatorial system operating in relation to the all things.
A.H. So do you take it that "it became him", is as if that is a kind of reference to an added glory attaching to God that He should operate thus?
S.McC. I think so, because heretofore, as indicated in the previous chapter, He had been known in many ways. We get Genesis opening with the great blessedness of God in the supremacy of His Being, Elohim, a Being to be worshipped in that sense, the sense of His supremeness. Then you get Jehovah Elohim, then you get El Shaddai, the Almighty, then you get Jehovah, but when we come to this movement towards men in Christ in the New Testament, we have God coming into the paternal relation that John refers to
{228}
in his gospel and seen in such wondrous glory in it, and it says, "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings". I think there is a definite link with the ministry of John's gospel in the way that this is alluded to.
A.H.G. Have you in mind that the word 'salvation' would involve our being brought into all these blessings of which you have spoken, the enjoyment of them?
S.McC. Yes, I think the salvation has in mind the glory, the "bringing many sons to glory", and in order that that should be so, extrication is needed, so that what colours John's gospel in that relation is what is '*up*' on the way out of the world, involving our salvation.
R.H.S. Could you say something about the thought of "through sufferings"?
S.McC. Well, what a touching reference that is It is "to make perfect the leader of their salvation", not through death, the word 'death' is employed a little bit earlier, but here it says, "through sufferings", as if we are to be reminded of the particular aspect of the sufferings of Christ in this relation.
E.J.H. Would glory be put upon the persons of whom it is said by the Lord, "They are not of the world, as *I* am not of the world", @John 17: 16?
S.McC. That is what I thought, that the "bringing many sons to glory" links with what is in the Lord's mind in @John 17 as He speaks to the Father, and "the leader of their salvation through sufferings" involves, "I sanctify myself", only here it became God in this relation, but there the Lord is in perfect accord with it, He sanctified Himself. That is all the suffering of going through death and into glory via that way, was in His mind.
A.J.G. There would have been something lacking
{229}
in the light in which God was known, if this matter of suffering had not been entered into.
S.McC. Exactly, so that it touches the moral side in that sense which gives great lustre to the glory of this Person in our eyes if we can so speak of it, that there is this added thought of glory. He was all-glorious in Himself as to His Person, perfect and complete, but the coming via this way, as it were, becoming an effective means of bringing on to our view His glory in a unique way through suffering.
J.R. I would like to ask whether the reference to @Psalm 8 in verse 9, and the addition of the words "on account of the suffering of death", link on with the thought expressed as to the sufferings in verse 10.
S.McC. I think so, that is part of the sufferings of Christ. The "suffering of death", it is a very striking expression, because it was not only necessary that the Lord should endure the active sufferings on the cross, but it was necessary that He should enter death itself, and think of what that experience was to Him passively as we take account of the "pains of death" as alluded to in @Acts 2: 24.
J.T.S. Does this emphasise for us the necessity and the desirability, too, of suffering, the Hebrew saints had clearly taken up this matter? Are we to do this and to be prepared to suffer -- "ye endured much conflict of sufferings", chapter 10: 32.
S.McC. We would learn from the leader of our salvation in that way how He went through suffering, and that is to affect us, because detachment from things here would involve suffering, but He has gone through suffering in view of these thoughts being reached.
F.C.M. I was thinking of the word of Jehovah through Moses to Pharaoh, "Let my son go, that he may serve me" (@Exodus 4: 23). Would that be intended to effect our complete extrication from the world, the world having no claim to us, involving
{230}
suffering, but having in mind the glorious system?
S.McC. Yes, I think in effect it would. God had in mind the wilderness there, that they would serve Him on that mountain in the wilderness. Of course, Hebrews generally is a wilderness epistle, it is dealing with our position in responsibility and our position in the wilderness, but these few verses here really carry us outside of the wilderness. It is as if they are brought in to give tone and substance, as apprehended by us and our souls are affected by them, to the great service of God in the sanctuary, for the letter has in mind the sanctuary and our position in it under the hand of Christ.
G.W.B. In this connection do you think it is suitable in the service of God, particularly in addressing the Lord, that there should be some reference to His sufferings or otherwise?
S.McC. I do not think we can forget His sufferings in this exalted relation, because the point, of course, is not to focus our attention on the suffering, but rather on the Leader of our salvation, but He has been perfected through suffering. He has reached the position in which He is to be taken account of as viewed here through suffering. The suffering is not the end but the means to the end.
G.W.B. One might just add, I have been told recently that there is still difficulty with some in regard to the use of Hymn 8 in the service of God, because of the reference to the Lord and His path, which would include His suffering. The suggestion is that we are beyond that, and I was wondering whether what you have been saying has a bearing on that, and whether it would be helpful.
S.McC. I think it helps to see how the truth is presented in this epistle, that certain things are brought in that are incidental. They are not the prime thought, but they are brought in and, as it were, project added glory on to our view in relation
{231}
to the Person, and that is how I understand Hymn 8. Suffering is not the prime thought in the hymn, it is the Person, but these things are referred to in relation to the Person, as only serving to make the glory of the Person more stand out before our souls.
D.J.H. I was thinking in connection with that, of the sufferings of the Christ and the glories to follow. It is the glories that are in view, sufferings being the way to it.
S.McC. Just so.
P.H.H. Does the fact that the sufferings here are not detailed at all, serve to steep our minds in the feature of suffering, so that in the wilderness we would accept it as being part of our pathway there, just as we gladly accept the glory of the service in the sanctuary? Would the sufferings in that sense, of Christ in one sense, of the saints in another, serve to give us a balanced mind about it all?
S.McC. I think they would, and also the passage in @2 Corinthians 4 as to the eternal weight of glory, as it says, "For our momentary and light affliction works for us in surpassing measure an eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things that are not seen; for the things that are seen are for a time, but those that are not seen eternal" (verses 17, 18). Well, this is one of the things that are not seen, "bringing many sons to glory" opens up the great unseen spiritual realm. The affliction, as it were, is affected by that in our minds, and instead of falling under the power of circumstances, which have such preponderance in our minds at times we are affected by what is eternal.
H.W. Does it help to see that these quotations which follow are from @Psalm 22, giving us the account of the greatest sufferings of Christ, with the accomplishment of the great work of redemption, and do we not have in Scripture, various references to the depth of response that flows from that glorious work?
{232}
S.McC. So that @Psalm 22 is the great suffering Psalm. We might say the intensest form of suffering is before us in @Psalm 22, and yet what emerges from it all, is what is on our view here, what is for God and the praises of Israel, the praises of the assembly.
H.W. And extending to the ends of the earth.
S.McC. Just so.
G.H.S.P. It is John in his gospel who brings in the blood-shedding on the cross. Does that have any bearing on this exalted level of suffering?
S.McC. Well, it does, and the blood would always affect our souls in that sense, keeping in mind that all that bears upon the public side, the doorway to the great divine system, the portal to the great realm of glory.
E.J.H. If I remember rightly, Mr. Taylor has said something like this, that it depends on what is in the mind and heart of the priest when he is serving, as to what he gives expression to.
S.McC. Yes.
E.J.B. In verse 10, God is the Operator, in verse 11 the stress is on what Christ is doing, does that link with your subject as to the prominence given to Christ in this section?
S.McC. Yes, it does. It is very affecting in verses 11 and 12, how the Lord comes on to our view. Reference was made this morning to the fact that the Spirit comes on to our view in His personal dignity in @Revelation 22, speaking to the Lord Jesus along with the bride, here there comes on to our view, another setting in which one divine Person speaks to Another as standing related to those He is not ashamed to call His brethren, saying, "I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises". Think of the glory of Christ in the perfection of His humanity as it comes on to our view here in regard to the great service of God.
{233}
F.W.K. Is verse 11 from the divine side, and would the bearing of it have a detaching effect upon us?
S.McC. I thought it would, that is, we have got the highest and fullest aspect of sanctification here, "For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one"; what a detaching effect that would have on us, because how could we have part in anything common or anything that would be degrading to our privileged part in this light, if we were firmly in the good and gain of what is here?
H.W. Does this thought "all of one" take us back again to @John 17, and the Lord's wonderful words there with regard to His own, in sanctifying Himself in view of this great matter that we should be all of one; speaking to His Father with regard to it?
S.McC. Yes, the difference between the two would be that here in @Hebrews 2 it is the great work of Himself that is presented, "he that sanctifies"; our sanctification in @John 17; "that they also may be sanctified" (verse 19); has in mind that we come into it through the bearing and application of the truth upon us, the truth of His position in glory, working out practically in our detachment from things here as we are attached to Him in glory.
P.H.H. Would that peculiarly affect us as having an attachment to His Person in Manhood, being His brethren, and being said to be "all of one"? Does that mean all of the same holy stock and lineage the other side of death?
S.McC. Just so, and what follows flows out of that, as if to impress us with the dignity of the whole matter, and this should greatly affect us in our lives practically, not only in the assembly on Lord's day morning, but it should have a great effect on our lives practically, "he that sanctifies and those sanctified are all of one; for *which* cause he is not
{234}
ashamed to call them brethren, saying", that is, we have got a continuous matter here, "saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".
B.G.H. Would you say a word in connection with that, as to the service of God?
S.McC. What do you have in mind?
B.G.H. It is not necessarily limited to the name of the Father, is it? "I will declare thy name to my brethren".
S.McC. I think we have to take the context as to what is in mind and to keep in mind the whole bearing of the epistle. Hebrews presents God in the majesty of His Being in a remarkable way, and redemption is effected in the course of divine operations, and we are set free and brought right into the presence of that majestic Being as revealed in Christ, but then we have to make full room in our minds for the different relations in which God in His majesty is presented; for instance, it is Son-wise in the first chapter, God Son-wise; it is the same Being in all His majesty, but He is presented Son-wise. In chapter 2: 10 - 12, it is God parental-wise, the whole subject in the context is family relationships, the sons and the brethren; it is God parental-wise and the wonderful glory that attaches to Him in this light, "bringing many sons to glory", making "perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings", and then, "for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren"; which links with @John 17, "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and *I* in them" (verse 26), the "I in them" links with what we have here in verse 12, "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", and it links with the new name in Philadelphia, the promise to the overcomer, "my new name".
{235}
A.W.P. Why do we not get the name of the Father in Hebrews, as Mr. Raven taught so firmly?
S.McC. Mr. Darby pointed it out, too. Hebrews is a wilderness epistle. It does not develop family relationships, and these verses that we have here ordinarily are not part of the general teaching of the epistle; they are like features of glory brought into the epistle to affect the general position, but in their substance they lie outside of the wilderness position. For instance sonship in relation to glory lies outside the wilderness position; the brethren of Christ is a thought that lies outside the wilderness position; in the midst of the assembly is a thought which lies outside the wilderness position, it is the assembly according to purpose and counsel.
R.G.B. Has it not been said that these two verses are perhaps the highest point in the epistle, linking perhaps more directly in their teaching with Ephesians?
S.McC. Yes; so that we may have thoughts brought into letters, as we have in Romans in another relation, and as we have in this section in Hebrews, which link us with higher levels of the truth than are in mind in the general teaching of the epistle.
F.W.K. Is that why the third chapter begins "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling"? I wondered whether it would confirm what you are saying as to the book generally contemplating the saints as in the wilderness, but they are a heavenly people.
S.McC. Yes. The epistle generally takes account of them as in the wilderness and therefore there is a powerful ministry to help them in that setting.
P.H.H. The mention of these details in verses 10, 11 and 12, are they like rays of glory to encourage us onwards, without opening out what they mean in fulness?
{236}
S.McC. I think so; I think that is the point, and especially to affect our souls in relation to Christ's humanity, that is, in the wonderful position in which He is viewed here as declaring the name of God to His brethren and in the midst of the assembly singing God's praises, and as it says, "again, I will trust in him". All is pointing to His humanity in this wonderful and unique setting.
A.J.G. Do you regard the assembly here in this verse as the assembly of such distinguished persons, the assembly of firstborn ones as we have later on in the epistle? It is a very wonderful company that the Lord should take His place in the midst of it and all who compose it are all of one with Him.
S.McC. It is, indeed, and the epistle to the Hebrews is to help us to see the greatness of the saints in this setting, so that in the next passage "such a high priest *became* us". Well, what could the reference be except to what the saints are according to the glorious thoughts that we are referring to in chapter 2? "Became us", the 'us' would link on with these exalted thoughts as to the brethren of Christ and what the personnel of this great vessel is, "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises".
A.H. Would you think that this remarkable reference to the Lord, or really "he that sanctifies" singing in the midst of such persons who form the assembly, is to help us to be in that position feelingly?
S.McC. I think so, and the sufferings and their apprehension by us, and what went earlier, "Jesus, who was made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour"; it would always augment the feeling side with us in view of what we have in these verses. When we come to chapter 7 we get the thought of the high priest and the minister of the holy places. We have already referred to the fact that it says, "For such a high priest became us". We are to be
{237}
impressed with the dignity of the saints according to their heavenly calling; they are no ordinary persons, therefore this in itself has a detaching effect upon us, and especially as apprehending the glory of Christ in His high priestly office in this relation.
F.P.S. Why does the "Son perfected for ever" come in here?
S.McC. It is to draw our attention to the great advantages that we have in the priestly system as we are now linked with it, because there are two things that throw into relief the contrast between the new system and the old, and that is the "swearing of the oath", and the "Son perfected for ever". That makes the priesthood of Christ unique in contrast to the old, because the "swearing of the oath" did not enter into the old priesthood, nor do we have the thought of the "Son perfected for ever".
A.J.G. So that the whole position is dignified by the glory of the One who is the High Priest.
S.McC. That is it. That is we have the glory of Christ personally as giving its own touch to the whole system, and we have the glory of the saints too, as giving their touch to the system.
P.H.H. Is that why the mind of the saints is built up in this great personage of Melchisedec? It says in verse 4, "Now consider how great this personage was". Is the mind being built up in the greatness of His Person in order to reflect greatness on the saints?
S.McC. It is. It is very interesting to see how Melchisedec in that way is brought in, the mystery linked with this personage, how he is brought in to throw into relief the glory of Christ as apprehended in relation to Christianity. We know from the opening of the chapter that Melchisedec met Abraham who was occupied with the detachment of Lot. The whole scene in which Melchisedec appears was linked with the detaching of Lot who had got into captive
{238}
hands, and Abraham is blessed by Melchisedec as returning from this operation. It reminds us of how great this matter of detachment is, because it says of Christ here in regard to His priestly office and service, "he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God".
A.J.G. And the effect of Melchisedec's service to Abraham was that Abraham refused to have even from a thread to a shoe latchet from the king of Sodom.
S.McC. Is it not helpful to see how these things all link together? We see the complete independency of Abraham from the world system typified in the king of Sodom. This epistle is to help us in relation to all that in our attachment to Christ and our links with Him as the type is set out in Melchisedec, "a priest for ever", as is referred to.
W.M.B. Would you say a word as to the expression "become higher than the heavens"? Would that bear on what you are bringing before us as to His outstanding personal glory?
S.McC. It would, that bears on what we were saying earlier, that interwoven in the subject of the Lord's priestly office is this matter of His deity and His humanity -- "higher than the heavens", that could be said of no creature; it immediately projects on to our view the greatness of the Person, as One who was divine.
R.H.S. Is that seen in the words, "because of his continuing for ever"?
S.McC. That is it, that is there will be no breakdown in this. This chapter @Hebrews 7 teaches us, in Jewish language, what @Romans 7 teaches us in moral language in regard to our deliverance, that is there is a change of law and a change of system, and we have to go through that in our souls experimentally. We get, for instance, the law of fleshly commandment, that could bring in nothing perfect.
{239}
It is referred to in relation to its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law perfected nothing, but what we have come to is what perfects everything and what is marked by strength and profit, complete salvation.
P.H.H. Is it not wonderful that we are said to have such an One, "We have such a one high priest ... minister of the holy places"? I suppose that refers back to the Lord Jesus, but in the setting of the type of Melchisedec. I was wondering whether the greatness of it might strike us afresh. In reading through about Melchisedec, we would think that He was a divine Person and so on, and yet the saints are said to have Him as a high priest.
S.McC. "We have such", the word 'such' is very fine in that relation, "We have such a one high priest, who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens". The mysterious reference to the "greatness in the heavens" is also calculated to affect our souls, how the Lord is viewed in that way in His humanity, alongside of Deity which is no doubt in mind in the expression "greatness in the heavens".
J.T.S. You made reference to "minister of the holy places", have you something more in your mind to say as to that?
S.McC. I think it links on with the new name, the renown of the Lord in the new name in the promise to the overcomer in Philadelphia, that over against what is passing away, old and decrepit as viewed in this epistle, and what is around us in Christendom, the Lord is taken account of by the assembly in the uniqueness of His renown as the "minister of the holy places". What a glory attaches to Him in that relation, in the official position, leading the praises of the assembly in relation to God!
A.H. Is there attractiveness too in the way the Melchisedec priesthood is first touched upon, where
{240}
it says, "within the veil"; as if to carry us right into the very presence of God Himself?
S.McC. Well, that is very interesting. We have a reference to the holiest in the last passage that we read. It is interesting the dual reference to the holiest in Hebrews. The holiest is presented as a wilderness thought into which we have access individually, into the presence of God, but it is also presented in a great enlarged setting as in chapter 9, the presence of God, and the vast scene of glory in which Christ is seen so wondrously in it. So that in chapter 10 we get a very practical bearing of it in relation to our apprehension of Christ. Earlier the chapter had been referring to His coming into humanity and taking away the first that He might establish the second, then it says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the holy of holies by the blood of Jesus, the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh, and having a great priest over the house of God, let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water". We have been speaking about the exalted thoughts that attach to us in the epistle, now we come to this practical exhortation as to drawing near, that we are to see to these matters in approaching, of a true heart, hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience, and bodies washed with pure water.
A.H. Is it of note therefore that such a word as this is addressed to persons who are said to be worshippers once purged?
S.McC. It is, this chapter is dealing with the worshippers. The law could not perfect the worshippers, it could not perfect those who approach. Chapter 9 opens up the sanctuary, and how the way has been cleared in relation to the realm where God is served, but chapter 10 brings on to view the
{241}
worshippers and how the worshippers are perfected through the work of Christ. But here we come to our moral exercises, for we cannot draw near or approach in any kind of way, we draw near in keeping with all that has been wrought in a mediatorial way by Christ.
H.W. In the second chapter of Ephesians we read how that we have come near, "Ye who once were afar off are become nigh by the blood of the Christ" (verse 13). Here in Hebrews, the verse we are looking at, it is "by the blood of Jesus" -- would you say something as to that?
S.McC. I thought it was a personal reference that would be particularly calculated to touch our feelings. In the previous chapter where the official side is seen in relation to the sanctuary, it is constantly "the blood of the Christ", that anointed One, the great divine Operator, but when you come to boldness for approach and encouraging us to draw near, it is the "blood of Jesus", and then it is "through the veil". It is not the rent veil as we notice, it is an allusion to the humanity of Jesus and how it has become instrumental in this matter of our drawing near, and then he added a thought "having a great priest over the house of God". Everything is conducive to our drawing near in keeping with what divine Persons have done.
S.G.B. Does the blood of Jesus make our approach a heart matter?
S.McC. I think so, that is what we were referring to as touching the spiritual emotions and feelings. Then "the new and living way" links on with the way into the full apprehension and contemplation of the Lord's glory in relation to His new name, with which the service of God and the minister of the sanctuary have a peculiar link.
G.H.S.P. Would you carry forward into that the allusion to Christ as the One who has the key of
{242}
David, in view of opening up the best in connection with the service of God?
S.McC. Exactly, it involves that. It is striking that the address to Philadelphia begins with the key of David, the holy and the true. That is, you would expect the persons in Philadelphia standing related to Christ, to be in consistency with that, and that is what @Hebrews 10 is stressing, that the persons are to be in consistency in the approach to God through Christ, in practical holiness, washed as to their body with pure water.
{243}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (3)
@Romans 5: 15 - 21; @Colossians 1: 14 - 29; @Ephesians 1: 19 - 23
S.McC. We are considering together the subject of the glory of Christ as it is intended to affect us, especially on the eve of translation as reference was made to the words of Rebecca to the servant, "Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil and covered herself", @Genesis 24: 65. I think the Spirit of God would help us to understand more and more what that means, the veil to cover herself, and these passages have been suggested for consideration this morning because of the way in which they advance on our view the glory of Christ, particularly bearing on His headship. The mystery of iniquity is working already in view of the great apostasy when the world will set up a rival head to Christ. The apostasy will fully set in when that head is set up. It is the great object of the enemy to produce a rival to Christ, and he operates in the world with this in mind, and he operates in the assembly too insidiously all the time, affecting the public body as he has, so that we find a rival head even in that which bears the name of God publicly, and therefore the need of coming under the Spirit's power and influence so that we should be delivered from the influence of every head that is rival to Christ. The unnamed woman in the ending of the synoptic gospels by her act at the end of the pathway of Christ, makes clear where she stands, so I think in the assembly at the present moment there is to be a clear sense of where we stand in relation to Christ, over against all that is operating to move athwart the great thoughts and rights of God. Matthew and
{244}
Mark and the unnamed woman in Simon the leper's house, would link with the public position, but in John's gospel Mary comes in a little bit earlier, we might say, from one point of view, and she is named. She anoints the Lord and she names Him, and it makes way for the wonderful opening up of the thoughts of the economy of love, and the divine arrangement into which divine Persons have come. I think the Spirit's ministry in all these scriptures would have in mind the building up of our souls in the knowledge of Christ's glory so that we become more and more practically detached. We have been using the word 'detached' a lot, and the Spirit has in mind, on the eve of translation, that we should be more and more detached from everything around us, and detached from the features of the man of sin and shame in our own hearts, and there is only one way in which that detachment effectively comes about, and that is through the advancement of Christ's glory in our souls.
So that in @Romans 5 we have Christ's headship alluded to uniquely in relation to the race. Christ's headship in connection with man, over against Adam who was the federal head of the human race, but who fell through sin. Christ is brought on to our view as the Head of the race according to the truth of the glad tidings in which God's thoughts and blessings for men are presented, so that it is Christ's headship on moral lines in relation to the sin question, delivering us and detaching us from lawlessness and independency. In Colossians, where we have the glory of Christ advanced on our view, it is the personal glory of Christ and His headship, standing related to the assembly, His body. If we are not basically affected by this in the truth of the gospel and our foundations are not right in regard to it, we shall never be right in the assembly. In Romans the kingdom must have its way in authority in the teaching in our souls,
{245}
so that we are obedient and dependent and moving in our orbit rightly as would be indicated in our attachment to Christ in this light. Then we have the powerful presentation of the Person of Christ, which is very affecting in Colossians, to detach us from the subtle and insidious working of things that so easily might deceive us as man's mind comes into the holy things of God.
Then in Ephesians, Christ's glory and greatness are advanced on our view, more on official lines as the great Head over all things to the assembly. The vast system of things upon which His headship bears, is before us, God having in mind earlier (the verses we did not read) "to head up all things in the Christ" (verse 10), and then the assembly sharing in that headship in such a unique way as by Him, like the queen, in gold of Ophir, by the side of the king in @Psalm 45. I thought we might get help in relation to these thoughts; there is much detail in these passages that we have read that we shall not have time to dwell upon, but if we keep to these main thoughts we may get help.
S.H.N. Do you think there is to be a moral justification for the promise to Philadelphia that we were considering yesterday, "I also will keep thee out of the hour of trial, which is about to come upon the whole habitable world" (@Revelation 3: 10), in having our interest and our life centred in our Head, in Christ, and so detached from the earth and the world that is coming under judgment?
S.McC. I think there certainly is; there is to be that. There is that contemplated in Philadelphia that corresponds with Him who is the holy and the true, so that the justification of life, for instance, alluded to in @Romans 5, lays the basis for that kind of thing, that is the justification of life involves what we are in the testimonial position, before the world and before men.
{246}
A.H. Do you think the peculiar moral worth of Christ is presented therefore in this chapter, in @Romans 5, "the free gift in grace, which is by the one man, Jesus Christ, ... the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ", and then in the end of the chapter "eternal life *through* Jesus Christ our Lord"? Is that to project Christ as the one Man on our vision, to attach our hearts to Him?
S.McC. Exactly, and the emphasis on divine gift alongside of that is very important, because there are a good many younger brethren here, and it is important that we should see in @Romans 5, in the great rudiments of the gospel, how our souls are to be built up in the knowledge of divine giving, so that property is acquired; substance is acquired in the knowledge of God in Christ, in the knowledge of Christ and the Spirit, that becomes wealth in view of the construction and building of the sanctuary.
E.J.H. Is it to be noted that the Lord, in the forty days of His resurrection, spoke of the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the next word is that He assembled with them forty days speaking of the kingdom?
S.McC. So that the Lord would impress upon them the great thought of the kingdom, not only in its subjugating feature, but in the positive wealth that lies in the realm, the things concerning the kingdom of God. In the world we get brochures illustrating the different countries and the attractive features that mark them, their resources and the like, to attract us to them. @Romans 5 is like that, it is the great description of the wealth and attractiveness that is linked with the kingdom of God through divine gift, and that as by faith our souls acquire the gift, we are built up in the knowledge of divine giving in that sense.
E.B.S. Does this thought of God's giving help towards detachment more than anything else?
{247}
S.McC. It does. What has the world to give as we contemplate what @Romans 5 opens up in such richness and fulness in divine gift? The Spirit is referred to so early as shedding abroad in our hearts the love of God. All that is to give the believer a good start, as it were, just as we have in the operations of the mediatorial system early in Exodus.
F.V.W. Do we see it in @John 4, the Lord speaks there about the giving God and in the end the woman leaves her water-pot, she is emancipated?
S.McC. Yes, it works out in a detaching effect with her, so that she leaves things, she is so affected by the Lord's proposal.
R.H.S. Would you say something about the receiving of the abundance of grace in connection with this thought of the gift?
S.McC. We are to notice all these expressions, "the free gift in grace", and the "abundance of grace", and "the free gift of righteousness". We are to notice the richness of these expressions, and the liberality and gratuity of divine giving that is suggested in them, so that the believer, as getting a sense of this, and as the truth of the glad tidings gets a place in his soul, becomes imbued with the liberality of divine giving, and thereby he is greatly affected in regard to God, as being brought to God in this way.
P.H.H. Is our attachment to Christ somewhat illustrated in the early history of David as being chosen by God, and given by God, and then his exploits as with Goliath and gradually everybody centring in affection upon him? Is that somewhat illustrative of the headship of Christ in this portion of scripture?
S.McC. I think it is, so that as we get indicated in David as a type of the believer, there was a remarkable sense of obligation accepted, and it seems to one,
{248}
that as the truth of the glad tidings is rightly taken on in faith, and is rightly affecting us, it works up to this great thought of the acceptance of obligation in the localities in which we are set. For instance David says, Was it not laid upon me, and we know the obligations he accepted in regard to the ark and the house of God, a type of the assembly. @Romans 5, I think, is intended to affect us in this way, detaching us from the world with all its material values in which we can easily get enmeshed, our jobs, our work, our families and our businesses, overpowering us and crippling us in view of assembly obligations, assembly life. @Romans 5 in the lavishness of divine giving that is projected on to our view, would help us, as faith enters into it, to take on and to accept obligations as the latter part of Exodus shows.
W.H.L. Does chapter 12: 1 enter into this, "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the compassions of God", would that include what you are speaking of as this free giving in chapter 5?
S.McC. That is right, so that while the Holy Spirit is viewed in relation to our hearts in @Romans 5 it works out to our bodies in @Romans 12, so that our bodies are on the altar as a living sacrifice, a remarkable thing, I mean the way our bodies are referred to, the body of the believer in relation to what is spiritual. We might make a wide line of demarcation between our bodies, physical as they are, and what is spiritual, but Scripture closely allies the two. The body is on the altar, never the flesh, the body is on the altar a living sacrifice; and Paul says in @1 Corinthians 6, "Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ?" (verse 15), not our souls, not our spirits or our hearts, but our bodies, showing the close link there is between our bodies and what is spiritual.
S.E.W. You have referred twice to the question raised by Rebecca as to who is the man coming to meet us, would that be the outcome of what the
{249}
servant had bestowed upon her in his giving and adornment previously?
S.McC. That comes into it. We have to be reminded, of course, of what is in advance of @Romans 5. @Romans 5 is dealing with the great principles of divine giving in the truth of the gospel, in view of the laying of a right foundation. Much comes in later through the Spirit's service and activities, in the way of ornamentation and adorning, but @Romans 5 to 8 is the under-shoring, under-pinning work, that is necessary in our souls in view of being right assembly men and women.
E.C.M. Does this lay the basis for priesthood? I was thinking of @Exodus 19, where Jehovah says, "Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and how I have borne you on eagles¬ wings and brought you to myself" (verse 4), and then He immediately speaks about "and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests" (verse 6). Do the first nineteen chapters in that way link with @Romans 5 from the divine side?
S.McC. They are all in view of our souls being built up in spiritual property and wealth that becomes serviceable in the sanctuary, serviceable in the construction of the sanctuary, and serviceable in the sanctuary as constructed.
E.J.B. Does the word 'constituted' in verse 19 indicate that this line of things, this presentation of Christ, is to affect the saints in their very constitutions?
S.McC. I thought so. The word 'constituted' is a fine word here in @Romans 5 in that sense, especially because of the way that the enemy is operating in the mystery of iniquity which is working. In schools and colleges, the rival head in principle is being advanced, and we are liable to be ensnared by it. All this is to build up our souls in the knowledge of divine giving, so that we are in the kingdom as independent of the world.
A.J.G. Would you say that the presentation of
{250}
the headship of Christ in this chapter, on moral lines, as the One Man, Jesus Christ, has in view the recovery of men for God here upon earth?
S.McC. That is it, exactly.
A.J.G. The one Man is exclusive of every other, is it not?
S.McC. That is it. That is why one referred to the woman in the synoptic gospels unnamed, and one Man stood out in her outlook; however many others there were around, and there were many in her day, one Man stood out, and not only did He stand out, but she anointed Him, she was committed to that great thought, that no other man, as it were, would exercise influence over her, but the one Man.
J.W.D. What would you include in the thought of moral obligation in our localities?
S.McC. Well, you take the matter of the covenant in Exodus. The spiritual significance of the first covenant involves that obligations are accepted, taken on, and that works out in the local position, so that we are not marked by lawlessness or independency as attached to Christ, in the light of what we are here, it immediately brings in to our minds the great feature of righteousness.
C.W.O'L.M. Does the matter of obedience connected with the "constituted righteous", establish the matter of obedience as a basic principle in the believer's constitution?
S.McC. I think so, so that the truth of the glad tidings is very important.
C.M.M. Could this be linked with Moses making the boards of acacia wood standing up?
S.McC. That would be what it would have in mind. The believer, as set up in the sense of divine gift, according to the truth of the glad tidings, is marked by stability, independent of the world in the sense of the moral system that the world constitutes. We get, of course, the chapters that follow that bring
{251}
in the experimental side, but chapter 5 is emphasising what is available from the divine side towards the believer.
P.H.H. Is the idea in the preaching of the glad tidings, that God is ready to transfer us from the headship of Adam to the headship of Christ, the one Man?
S.McC. Exactly, so that @Romans 6 brings that in experimentally into our souls. @Romans 6 involves the change of man, and I think that while these expressions were largely used in the early days of the recovery, perhaps there needs to be a review with us as to the great elements and rudiments of the truth in regard to the gospel, so that there are right foundations laid. Mr. Raven said, when a man goes off in later years he always wondered what stone was loose in his foundation. I am sure we all need to be concerned, not only the younger ones but all of us, about our foundation, so that there is no stone loose.
P.H.H. Therefore would you encourage us more to preach the Person, not excluding other things, but the Person must be the centre of everything in the preaching of the glad tidings?
S.McC. Because the presentation of the Person as exalted at God's right hand, the great Administrator, would involve a complete detachment at the very beginning from what is around.
A.H. And has all this in mind, to use beloved Mr. Taylor's expression, to put us in a substantial way amongst the ruling class? I was thinking of this reference to "reign in life by the one", it is preceded by "those who receive".
S.McC. I think what you say as to the ruling class is good in that sense, because @Romans 5 contains morally astronomical allusions. As the celestial bodies are held in their right orbit in relation to the sun, the father of the great solar system, the centre of the whole system, so the believer is held in his
{252}
right and proper orbit in relation to Christ. The celestial bodies represent in figure, the ruling class, and believers, as brought into this wonderful attachment to Christ through the glad tidings, belong to the ruling class. They will be the ruling class in the world to come.
R.G.B. Does what you are saying make the question of the gospel that is preached in our rooms a very important matter, and also the circulation of gospel literature, as the Trustees have in mind, that you were referring to yesterday? Would all that help in the development of a right constitution?
S.McC. I am sure it would because it is important that we carry with us all the time the spirit of the glad tidings, and that the truth of the glad tidings is constantly present in a detaching and delivering effect.
J.T.S. In @Acts 2, Peter says, "God has made him, this Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ" (verse 36), that raises the question, does it not, "What shall we do, brethren?" and they accept detachment in the fullest way, and Peter goes on "ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (verse 38)? Is this attachment to Christ that you are speaking of, effectual now by this?
S.McC. I think so, and we want to see the importance of this attachment to Christ that @Romans 5 has in mind, Christ as the divinely appointed Head, who has taken up all the liabilities of man, of the race, and discharged them to the glory of God, and as the One in whom everything is presented for men, and not only our attachment to Him, but there is also the thought of contact with Him. We did not read the verse, but "For if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much rather, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in the power of his life" (verse 10). That means that practical contact by the Spirit with Christ in
{253}
the present place in which He is, involves our salvation. It is important that the younger brethren see that, because why do persons go out of fellowship? They might say, the brethren are to blame, the brethren withdrew from them. They might say, O well, they did not have a right attitude, and all that, but whatever may be said, the crux of the matter is that every person normally speaking, who gets out of fellowship, has lost contact with Christ. The contact has been interfered with and broken, and it has worked out in that which involves the position that out of fellowship means.
C.H. I was going to ask in relation to these catastrophes that occur amongst us, you have spoken of our being out of contact with Christ, does it not also point to a deficiency in the truth of deliverance?
S.McC. I think it does, that is just what we are seeking to get at, that we all need to see the importance of our foundations, according to the truth of the glad tidings. It is a question not only of being detached from the world, but being detached from ourselves and the man of sin and shame linked with ourselves. If the detachment is complete then there will not be much difficulty, do you think?
C.H. In our assembly life together, does the education go on as to the practical change of man? I was struck with the way the apostle refers to Jesus Christ constantly in the first letter to the Corinthians particularly.
S.McC. That is very important. It is not something we leave, as if we have faced it and we have finished with it, it is something we carry along all the time. So that as he says to the Corinthians, "For other foundation can no man lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (@1 Corinthians 3: 11); it is that order of man.
R.H.S. Would you say something as to the end of chapter 5, it says, "to eternal life through Jesus
{254}
Christ our Lord", then the end of chapter 6, "eternal life *in* Christ Jesus our Lord" (verse 23).
S.McC. Well, I think that all helps to see that detachment is in mind. The brethren may think we are using this word 'detachment' too much, but I am sure the more it is considered, the more we will see the importance of it, our complete detachment from the world and from the first man. Eternal life alludes to an order of things that is out of the world, morally and spiritually, and it is always presented in Paul's ministry as an objective to be reached, and the truth of the glad tidings puts us on the way to it.
H.W. Does John the baptist, in the first chapter of John's gospel, shine out in that connection? He says, "Behold, the Lamb of God" (verse 36), and two disciples are detached from John and attracted to Christ?
S.McC. Well, you can see how completely John was detached from himself, and from Jerusalem with all its traditional and powerful influence that it had. How completely he was detached from it in the light of Christ's glory, Christ having eclipsed in his mind and his soul, every other man, and a true minister, like John the baptist, for he is a model in John's gospel, his ministry will always lead that way. If a ministry attracts itself to the minister in the sense of personality according to the flesh, results will be disastrous, for all true ministry must detach from man according to the flesh and link us with Christ.
H.W. These two disciples are really brought into their orbit with regard to the centre of the divine system.
S.McC. And that is a great matter with us that we should be in our orbit, our orbit in the kingdom, and our orbit in the assembly, in the local position, because whenever we get out of it we collide. When brethren get out of their orbit they collide, there is a
{255}
collision because of getting out of their orbit, and what leads to it is independent outlook, independency of the brethren, it always leads to the collision involved in getting out of our orbit.
A.E.M. Would you say that the orbit includes the matter of gift, too?
S.McC. Do you mean gift in the ministry?
A.E.M. Yes.
S.McC. In the light of what has been said about the ruling class, the sun and the moon and the stars, it is all part of a system of influence, in relation to which we are to be rightly held, and gift is part of that.
A.E.M. I was thinking of the Lord's sovereignty in the matter of gift, sometimes it makes a collision.
S.McC. Just so, and that would be a question as to whether we have been rightly subdued in our minds and wills through the truth of the glad tidings, do you not think, in our detachment from ourselves and our attachment to Christ.
A.E.M. The Lord may give a greater gift to another, we must recognise it as part of the service to us.
S.McC. Yes, and get the gain of it, and that would be very important in the local positions. While gift is not set in localities, yet the localities would get the gain of gift that may be resident there.
P.H.H. Is that why Paul writes to the Corinthians, a local company, and in talking about the gifts says, "God has set certain in the assembly", @1 Corinthians 12: 28?
S.McC. That is the passage I was thinking of in referring to the gift in the way one did. God has set them. It says in @Genesis 1, "Let there be light" (verse 3), and then God made the two great lights, and then "God set them in the expanse of the heavens" (verse 17). He *set* them, just as it is said of the gifts, that they are set there.
{256}
P.H.H. Does that mean that every local assembly is to regulate itself by the whole thought of the assembly, even in regard of gift?
S.McC. So that it is remarkable that the setting of the gift is not alluded to until after the thought of the body of Christ is covered. After he has gone over all the features that he has in mind to enlarge on in relation to the body of Christ, he immediately refers to God setting certain in the assembly, showing that the two sides are interlocked. Sometimes it might be thought that gift would overshadow the body, but if gift is operating effectively it will never overshadow the thought of the body, and vice versa, if the body is operating effectively it will never shut out the operation of gift, they are interlocked and interdependent.
A.E.M. Even Paul could take his place in the body with great satisfaction.
S.McC. Exactly.
R.H.S. Does the question of the orbit include the sisters as well as the brothers?
S.McC. Certainly it does, because in @Romans 5 the truth of the glad tidings includes all of us, young and old, brothers and sisters, and has in mind that we should be brought into our right orbit in attachment to Christ, delivered from the awful working of the mystery of iniquity. We may think of it in the world, but we are to see how near the enemy comes in the assembly to the upsetting of things amongst the brethren.
A.C.S.P. In connection with the glad tidings, are the saints in their orbit in the local meeting an essential part of, and support for, the preaching of Christ personally? I was thinking of your reference to the unnamed woman and what it says in Matthew, "Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has
{257}
done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her", @Matthew 26: 13.
S.McC. So what a background you have got in the brethren, in the saints for the promulgation of the glad tidings! When you think of the living appreciation of Christ that there is among the brethren, as in that woman, what a background to enhance the promulgation of the glad tidings.
A.C.S.P. In that connection might I enquire as to what has been suggested recently in some parts that sisters ought not to go out in support of the open-air preaching? What would you say about that, please?
S.McC. Sisters ought not to go out?
A.C.S.P. Yes, that is what has been said.
S.McC. What scripture would they support that from?
A.C.S.P. I do not know, I just wanted you to say something about it.
S.McC. Well, I could not give you a scripture that would support that. I could give you a scripture that *would* support the sisters going out into the open-air.
A.C.S.P. If you did so it would help.
S.McC. @John 4, the woman of Samaria. She would not be absent if she could possibly be there, "Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done" (verse 29). Her soul was full of the glad tidings as it had affected her, and I do not think the woman in @Acts 16, Lydia and the others, would be absent from the promulgation of the glad tidings in the public position if they could be there. There may be many reasons, of course, why sisters cannot be there, but when persons say sisters should *not* be there I think that is not according to the truth.
A.J.G. It is interesting that in @Philippians 4 Paul says, "I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist
{258}
*them* (and that is feminine) who have contended along with me in the glad tidings" (verse 3).
S.McC. Very good, that is an excellent passage, and allied with that @Psalm 68, "great the host of the publishers" (verse 11), the word is feminine, is it not?
J.T.S. Would the word in @Luke 8 also confirm what you were saying, "preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with him, and certain women" (verse 1)?
S.McC. Very good. Now we must come to Colossians. Romans brings up the moral side in relation to the sin question and bears upon the public position, justification of life and we also get reigning in life, which means that the believer, through the truth of the glad tidings, is above his circumstances, he is not under them. Justification of life means that there is complete testimony before men in his life as to his detachment, through the gospel, from man and the world around him; but Colossians is more the hidden side. Ephesians is the heavenly side. Colossians does not take us to heaven. Colossians is the hidden side in this world; Christ among the Gentiles, the hope of glory, involves the side of mystery, and Christ's headship is advanced on our view in such a remarkable way, because of who He is personally, so that the dual thoughts in relation to His personal greatness are to be noted, in relation to His deity and His humanity.
W.McK. Is this an appropriate point to ask you to say a little more about Rebecca covering herself? Is this in the presence of the Man whose glory shines in the epistle to the Colossians?
S.McC. I think it links on immediately with what we are coming to now, like Rahab too, who secreted the men under the flax. With Rebecca it is more the refined side that is in mind, she covered herself, that is she realises the side we are speaking about, the secret hidden side in relation to which the assembly
{259}
stands in connection with Christ, involving the mystery.
P.H.H. In using the word 'hidden' are you stressing that which the assembly would enshrine, and that which would be enjoyed in assembly life and assembly service? I was just hoping you might say a little more, please, about how the word 'hidden' would apply in the assembly as we know it.
S.McC. The world cannot follow there, they can follow up to a point. The world can go up to a certain point as in the burial of Jacob, you remember, there were those who went out of Egypt, the great throng and crowd, but they could only go as far as a certain point. From that point onward Joseph and those with him go, so that the world can only go to a certain point. They can see what is material and what is physical, but the hidden side involves what is spiritual, and involves the secret of the organism in the body's attachment to Christ, quickened in the life of the Head as the body is, a sensitive organism in which things operate with such delicacy.
G.H.S.P. Do we get both these thoughts at the end of the first preaching in the second of Acts? Peter first of all lays great stress on baptism and saving themselves from this untoward generation, is that like @Romans 5, and then the Spirit's comment on the hidden life which is brought to light in the persevering in the apostles¬ doctrine, breaking of bread, and so on?
S.McC. Very interesting, so that while the truth of the body was not unfolded in the early chapters of the Acts, the vital features of it were there in the working of the organism by the Spirit's coming in as He did, and the link they had with Christ through that.
P.H.H. I suppose the thought of what is hidden operates in the Supper itself, is that right? Because to follow what you have been saying, there is the
{260}
public side of persons sitting down to take the Lord's supper, but then there is the hidden side, in which the Lord comes in and is known to us. Does the Colossian side, so to speak, start there?
S.McC. Exactly, making way for His headship, the Supper would bring us together in a public way in love for one another. You cannot have the headship of Christ functioning rightly unless our relations with one another are right. The headship of Christ does not work arbitrarily, it works through the affections, and unless we are together rightly in affection we do not get the gain of the headship of Christ.
H.W. In our apprehension of the truth, does the truth of the body come first, or the truth of the head?
S.McC. The truth of the body involving our relations with one another, makes way for the head to come in in a functioning way, because the head comes in to function in relation to the body. There is the apprehension, of course, of the Head in His unique glory which comes first in Colossians.
H.W. Unless we are set together, as it says here, in love, there is not much likelihood of our apprehending or enjoying the headship of Christ.
S.McC. I do not think there is, so that the way we view one another in our localities becomes a very practical matter, and the love we have for one another, whether there is a certain moral distance between us, or whether the Supper, as we sit down to partake of it, has affected the active state of love that is intended to be amongst us.
H.W. So that at the beginning of this matter in Romans, the apostle reminds us that we are members one of another, and that is essential before we can come into the gain of the working of the Head, would you say?
S.McC. I think so. Romans does not develop the truth of the body, it just alludes to it in chapter 12
{261}
in such a way that we should be saved from isolation and independency. So many are deflected by independency and isolation in their outlook, and it is important that we should see the value of our links with one another in view of being preserved from that.
W.H.L. Does the presence of the Spirit enter into that, His being free among the brethren?
S.McC. It does, very much, because the Spirit is the binding power between the brethren. That is, He is the hidden bar, in the type, running through the boards of the tabernacle.
W.M.B. Is that seen in the one reference to the Spirit in this epistle, "your love in the Spirit" (chapter 1: 8) preceding all this?
S.McC. Very good. It is remarkable that not much is said about the Spirit in Colossians, although He underlies the whole matter, but the rare reference to "love in the Spirit" I think, is very apropos, coming in as it does, and where it does. In Ephesians you have constant reference to the Spirit, but Colossians is to make Christ prominent, and the life of Christ in the saints prominent.
E.J.H. Is the Spirit saying, "That is my master!" in Colossians?
S.McC. Exactly. In @Romans 8 the Spirit is life as it says, but not in Colossians, the Spirit is not life in Colossians.
P.H.H. Will you please say some more about Christ being our life, the life of the body in Colossians.
S.McC. I think the whole point in Colossians is to make much of Christ in that way, so that even in regard to the new man, Christ is everything and in all, He is everything as object, and in all as a characterising state. Christ is written over this whole epistle, so that we are to walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and thus we are delivered from the influence of man, and the mind of man entrenching in the holy realm of divine things.
{262}
A.W.P. So it is "Christ in you", not as Ephesians, the saints in Christ. Would that be essential, bringing in the body as being most essential in order that the flow from the Head might have the body in view?
S.McC. "Christ in you" emphasises the hidden position that we have been referring to, the secret position. It is like Joseph in Egypt; that is, he was apart from his brethren, and Christ is viewed apart from Judaism here. Judaism adds nothing to Christianity in this sense, it is what there is in a secret hidden way, apart from what is around us, so rich and so full.
A.J.G. And so does that flow out from Christ being held in the affections of the assembly?
S.McC. That is how I understand it.
A.J.G. So that you have "dead with Christ", "buried with Christ", "risen with Christ", "manifested with Christ", it is a question of being with Christ all through, is it not?
S.McC. Exactly.
A.L.O. Going back for a minute, could you indicate how those who are sitting behind can be attracted from what is public to what is hidden?
S.McC. What is hidden, of course, works out in effect testimonially, that is, there is something there that affects those who are concerned, like Rahab was affected. She was on the outside, looking on, and there was something there in Israel that affected her, and affected the work of God sovereignly in her, so that she desired to be linked with it.
A.H. You referred yesterday to the great matter of Christ singing in the midst of the assembly, that would be the hidden side of things, would it not? But is it not calculated to powerfully affect the saints so that there is an outburst of praise from them, and does not that become public?
S.McC. That is, the power of it is felt testimonially. The assembly is affected by Christ's
{263}
Headship in the service of God, receiving all direction and impulse from Christ. The world does not understand that, but the power of it is felt testimonially.
E.C.M. You referred yesterday very much to the thought of the root and the offspring of David, do you think we might link that with the passage here as to the Person of Christ, His deity being asserted as also His manhood?
S.McC. That is what I was referring to in the dual thoughts that come into this letter to the Colossians. These first and second chapters are full of dual thoughts, for instance, verses 15 and 16 give Christ's pre-eminence in relation to the whole creation, "firstborn of all creation", and verse 18 brings in His pre-eminence in relation to the assembly. That is, you have got what is general in the whole creation. He is "firstborn of all creation"; involving the great sphere of divine majesty and glory, but then you get what is special, "he is the head of the body, the assembly; who is the beginning, firstborn from among the dead" (verse 18), involving that He has gone through the article of death, and He has gained the victory over death in His humanity. He is risen from among the dead, and His pre-eminence is seen in the special position over against the general position, but both features of His glory are calculated to affect us very much.
S.E.W. Would all this help us in relation to what you said as to Joseph being hidden? Was not Benjamin hidden, and was it not when Benjamin was seen with the brethren that the heart of Joseph was moved in relation to his brethren, and would the brethren be affected by that?
S.McC. So that you have what is general with Joseph, and you have what is special. You have got the great realm in which Joseph is administering, involving, as we might say, the whole creation of God in figure, and where God, in an abstruse way
{264}
suggested in Pharaoh, is to be Supreme. But then you have what is special; you have Joseph's brethren upon whom he focuses his attention, and they coming into the gain of such intimate contact with him, and his embrace of them. So you get it working out in Paul; he speaks of the glad tidings, he speaks of it in relation to the whole creation, but then he channels our thoughts into what is special, "I rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up that which is behind of the tribulations of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the assembly", showing how we are to have these great thoughts in relation to Christ's glory before our souls.
{265}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (4)
@Colossians 2: 6 - 10, 16 - 19; @Colossians 3: 1 - 4; @Ephesians 3: 14 - 19
S.McC. The thought in mind in suggesting these passages to be read is to augment what we had this morning in relation to the glory of Christ and His headship, and these passages involve the place that Christ has in the hearts of the saints and in their affections. This is a very important matter because we so easily speak of Christ being supreme in our hearts, when He may not be supreme at all, when we may perhaps not be rightly delivered from things here and from ourselves. It is important therefore that we should see the quality in these letters that is in mind to be reached, especially when we come to Ephesians where the full thought of union is arrived at, involving, as it does, by the Spirit, our links with Christ in heaven. There is nothing more detaching than that, not only as to the world, and as to the man of sin and shame, but as to place, the earth, and all that is linked with what may detain us and hinder us in a more subtle and insidious way. Colossians has in mind Christ coming on to the view of our souls in such a way that we should be prepared and ready for the passing over into the realm where He dwells in our hearts by faith, the heavenly domain and realm where He has such a place, both officially and personally too, "the Christ" particularly pointing to the great operations, and the quality of the operations. So that what we began with in Philadelphia has in mind the thought of quality, and quality on assembly lines, and these letters have that in mind, because it is a question of what is near and next the heart of Christ in these letters. The brethren will remember Mr. Stoney once said, in that lecture of his, 'The
{266}
Nature, Order and Responsibility of the Church, the Body of Christ', that you hear people say the corporate thing is all over, he says, it is quite evident that they do not know what is near Christ's heart, and if they do not know what is near Christ's heart, how can they understand any other feature of the truth? It is very important to see in that way how the presentation of Christ in all His glory has in mind what He is in relation to the assembly in these epistles, and especially the assembly as linked with Himself in the great domain of glory that He fills as in Ephesians, beginning with this passage in @Colossians 2 which follows up @Colossians 1, "As therefore ye have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him, rooted and built up in him". You will notice that in verse 8 Paul uses the emphatic 'you', and the Note points out that the 'you' is emphatic, but the verb 'be' is in the future, implying real present danger more than possibility. That is there was great danger besetting the Colossians, and therefore the conflict comes into view in a peculiar way in what Paul says about the combat. It is a great thing that we should be in the conflict with Christ and the assembly in mind, not giving up the great thought as in the divine mind. Mr. Stoney said, the harder the conflict the deeper or the stronger the virtue. He illustrated the matter of the conflict and referred to the man, when the colours were about to be captured, he pulled down the colours and wrapped himself in the colours, and said, if you take the colours you must take me. In these letters that are before us the teaching involves that, as we enter in our souls into the blessedness of our links with Christ.
A.H. In this verse 6, the word is "As therefore ye have received the Christ", not believed the Christ exactly, but "received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in him, rooted and built up in him". Would you say something about that?
{267}
S.McC. It is very interesting the way it is put here. It would involve more than the reception of Christ as Saviour, the Christ involving the anointed, Jesus being His personal name, and the Lord bringing in the place He has in authority. I think it involves that we have made way for Christ in relation to the supreme operations that these letters, Colossians and Ephesians, have in mind. That is not only in relation to the moral question and our release from it, but in relation to the great operations concerning Christ and the assembly.
A.J.G. Is not "the Christ" a very exclusive title? There is only one Christ, there are many antichrists, but only one Christ.
S.McC. Very good, it stands out in that sense -- there are many antichrists we are told, but there is only one Christ in that sense.
H.W. I hope it is not diverting you, in speaking about Christ and the assembly, and what the assembly is to Christ, but I wondered if it would be out of place to ask you to say a word as to why we see the assembly, the bride, by herself so prominently brought before us at the end of Revelation.
S.McC. I think it is to remind us how divine thoughts go through. As we referred to in Mr. Stoney's word on that remarkable occasion, the bride would have in mind that we do not lose sight of what is near and next Christ's heart. The bride brings that on to our view as a feminine entity unaffected by the breakdown and the failure; she appears in all the freshness and ardency of what has been wrought in her, in perfect alignment with another divine Person, the Spirit, saying to the Lord Jesus, "Come".
H.W. The great point, do you think, being to display divine workmanship in its beauty and perfection?
S.McC. I thought so, because it is interesting that
{268}
you get the bride also mentioned in the allusion to the eternal scene where God's supremacy is seen; it says, as a bride adorned for her husband. The thought here of walking in him, "rooted and built up in him", becomes testing to all of us, I think, because the faith, the system of the truth and the teaching are all linked with this.
A.J.G. Does it mean that we refuse every other influence and wisdom, but that which is derived from Christ?
S.McC. That is how I would understand it. The word 'rooted' is a remarkable word in this connection. We have it in other connections, but in this connection, rooted in this Person, the Christ, is important, "rooted and built up in him". The 'built up' follows the rooting, because so often, especially with those who are more prominent amongst the saints, there would be the tendency to be built up in ourselves.
P.H.H. Does the time at Hebron with David help at all as to this? In @2 Samuel 2 to the end of verse 4, where David himself and the house of Saul were somewhat against each other, it says of David, "but David became continually stronger" (chapter 3: 1); it says there also, "However, the house of Judah followed David", chapter 2: 10. Would that be somewhat like the increase of the glory of the Person of Christ with us in this intermediary position?
S.McC. I think so. David at that juncture bears very much on what we have here, it is a transitional moment, and Colossians is that, and it is fraught with real danger. It is not a matter of what may be possible, but there is real danger in the position, not so much from the external side of the world, but from the specious, insidious side where the capacity and power of man's mind comes in in a reasoning way, therefore the need of being fully established on this line, rooted and built up in the Christ, Jesus the Lord.
{269}
E.J.H. Do you think that the rooting refers to what is inward and secret, and the building up to what is outward and testimonial finally?
S.McC. Yes, I think it would involve that, and I think it would involve more. It involves what we are under the eye of God as built up in that blessed One. Allusion has been made to David's history, and a good deal of reference has been made to the rival head that is soon to appear in the world, and linked with it the apostasy. In the history of David we get a remarkable setting out of it, the specious and insidious working in a counter system to Christ, typically in David, resulting in his dethronement for the moment as David had to leave Jerusalem. But all the specious elements that were operating in Joab, the widow and Absalom, Ahithophel, whose counsel was as the word of God in those days, the specious side of the counter-system need to be seen and the importance of being rooted and built up in Christ in this sense, over against the counter-workings and operations of that specious system.
R.H.S. Does this open up too the importance of right teaching, it says, "even as ye have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving"? I wondered if right teaching in that way, would always lead to the thought of thanksgiving.
S.McC. Yes, and you notice how it begins, it says "rooted and built up in him, and assured in the faith, even as ye have been taught". Now that is a great matter that we should all be assured in the faith, the faith referring to the scope of the truth as it has come out, as has been taught, and the importance of this word 'assured' in it. The Note says, "confirmed", so that we are not at loose ends, we are not in a vacuum in our minds, at a loss and wondering whether what has come out is really so, or is not so. We are not affected by speculation or the mere vagaries of the human mind, we are confirmed in the truth,
{270}
assured in it, "abounding in it with thanksgiving".
A.E.M. I think the young people have to be assured that the devil has a whole system contrary to Christ. It is a perfected system in the world.
S.McC. So that when we come to @Ephesians 4, Paul uses the word 'systematised', showing how powerful that kind of thing is to deflect the believer from what has been reached in Christ, and what is before God in Christ.
A.E.M. That is why when one gets away from the Lord one comes under darkness right away.
S.McC. It is rather remarkable that. Some of us were referring to it in connection with some who got out of fellowship in our own part of the world. In speaking to someone recently who was prominent amongst us, some were amazed at the darkness in the person's soul, showing that this specious counter-system that we have been referring to, that the enemy has, and will find its full-blown effect in the apostasy in relation to the rival head is operating now. It is a very real matter, and we need to see the importance of receiving Christ in this way and walking in Him, rooted and built up in Him.
A.J.G. Is the appreciation of Christ as One in whom all the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily, the great antidote to all that?
S.McC. That is it. It is very affecting the way it is put here, standing over against the great thoughts of Gnosticism. It is a real substantial matter in that sense that we have to do with, how God is known in Christ. There is nothing, as it were, unreal about it, as in the philosophy of men and what they propound in the way of theory. The use of the word 'fulness' in Colossians is to affect our souls, that is it is not theoretic or academic, it is what God is in Christ in the blessed way in which He is known that is to affect us in the way of richness in our souls.
P.H.H. It speaks of it in chapter 1, saying, "in
{271}
him all the fulness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell" (verse 19), and in chapter 2, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are complete in him" (verse 9), would you mind saying some more about this thought of fulness, because it has been noticed by all of us, no doubt, that Colossians and Ephesians mention fulness several times in different connections? I should be thankful if it could be pursued a little.
S.McC. In Colossians, as you will have observed, in the first chapter it is used almost as a title of Deity, a title of God, a remarkable way in which it is put, and here we get the thought of the Godhead which we do not have in the first chapter. There it is bracketed, that is, it is added to give the force, but here it is, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily". I think it should greatly impress us with the Person of Christ because in this 9th verse in chapter 2 it is not exactly mediatorial, that is it involves what Christ is, Christ is God, and Deity is presented in Christ, it comes on to our view in Christ, and this word 'fulness' carries us beyond what is arbitrary. It brings us to the great thought of what God is essentially as He has come out to be known by creature mind, in so far as creature mind and capacity can take in the thoughts of Himself.
P.H.H. Does it mean the complete expression of God in Man in that Person?
S.McC. It does, it is a wonderful thing to take account of it herein that sense 'bodily'. The addition of the word 'bodily' brings on to our view the Lord's humanity in its present glorious state, and how God, or the Deity, is apprehended in a Man and will be so apprehended eternally. That is, as has often been alluded to, the eternal subsisting state between God and man lies in a Man.
P.H.H. I think I remember Mr. Coates saying that the fulness, especially here, referred to the
{272}
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, all brought near to us.
S.McC. Just so, brought near to us in a Man. We see somewhat the fulness referred to in the first chapter without the mention of the word 'bodily', and we recall that when the Lord did anything He referred to the Father doing the work. He also referred to the Spirit in the doing of the works, showing that in the presence of the operations we are in the presence of God, known in that way. The word 'fulness', I think, is especially brought into the Colossian epistle to combat the Gnostic idea, where vagaries and theories were being propounded, so we get this word 'fulness', that is, it is what God is as fully known in Christ, that is in mind.
W.M.B. Would there be some link with the expression that the Lord Himself used, or referred to, speaking of the temple of His body?
S.McC. I am sure there is, His body was the shrine of Deity. What a thought that is as we take account of Him in His humanity in that sense.
A.J.G. And does the fact that it says, "ye are complete in him", involve that in our response to the light in which God is known, there need be no lack, no disparity?
S.McC. That is it. How remarkable the two sides are in that sense, the completeness of what is to be known of God towards us in this glorious Person, and then the completeness on our side in Him toward God, "ye are complete in him". There would be a kind of a link with what we were referring to, the Lord's renown in the mediatorial position in "my new name".
P.H.H. So that we need go outside of Christ for nothing.
S.McC. That would be the point.
P.H.H. In regard of response to God, do you think?
{273}
S.McC. So that we are greatly helped in view of richness in the service in the light of these wonderful statements.
A.H. Is there added to that, do you think, "ye are complete in him" the thought that you were referring to yesterday as to the glory that attaches to the saints in Christ?
S.McC. I think so, it is to show us the dignity of Christianity seen in the perfect answer in the saints in this way towards God, "ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and authority".
A.B. Does the word 'filled full' or 'complete', imply that the saints draw on Christ, and that He is great enough to fill the mind and the heart of the saints?
S.McC. The Note says, "filled full, referring to all fulness being in Him. The fulness or completeness of the Godhead is in Christ, as towards us; and we, as towards God, are complete in him". That is, nothing is lacking; we do not need to go outside of Him.
J.W.D. Is the experimental side of this always collective or can we enter into it individually?
S.McC. I suppose when we come to the experimental side there is a certain sense in which we must go through it individually, like the river in Ezekiel. It would be what we can reach into in our own souls and say of it, what we have touched in relation to it.
J.W.D. You mean as of the assembly?
S.McC. As of the assembly, yes.
C.H. Does that not raise the question of our real links with Christ? I was thinking of the way the Spirit of God refers to the Lord in verse 6, it is not only "the Christ", but "Jesus the Lord". There should be no spiritual hiatus in our history; we should go on growing in apprehension of Christ, who He is as well as what He has done?
S.McC. Exactly, and that greatly helps us in
{274}
regard to the assured, being confirmed in the faith, because the whole ambit of the truth, the scope of the truth, is in that Person, the Christ. He is the subject of testimony from beginning to end of the Scriptures, and if we receive the Christ in principle we receive the whole testimony of God, and therefore we are challenged as to what our links with Christ really are.
C.H. We may have appreciated at the first, Jesus the Lord, but do you think the Spirit of God would lead us on to this greater glory, seeing Him who is the Anointed in this wondrous system?
S.McC. Yes. In verse 8, it is remarkable the standards that are referred to, it says, "See that there be no one who shall *lead*", notice that word 'lead'; "lead *you* away as a prey through philosophy and vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ". That is the teaching of men and the elements of the world are contrasted to Christ, because the religious side is particularly in mind, and the operation of man's mind in it, intruding into the things of God as if the natural mind had capacity for reasoning and measuring the revelation of God in Christ.
E.C.M. Is the thought of substantiality in mind in the section?
S.McC. That is what we were referring to, the thought of the fulness in contrast to Gnosticism where the vagaries of the human mind are so terrible in that system that was present in the earlier days of the assembly. Paul has that in mind, and he brings in the substantiality of what we have in Christ. "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily".
P.H.H. Is this to make us at home in the presence of this great expression, "from God", so that while we reverently hold God in our souls worshipfully, we
{275}
are not set, so to speak, at a distance, but we regard Him as brought within our range in Christ?
S.McC. Yes. The mention of it here, "the fulness of the Godhead", would greatly help us in the latter part of assembly service, so that while in the presence of the majesty of Deity, as apprehended in Christ, in His glorious Manhood, there is a richness in our souls as filled full in Him in the responsive side towards all that has come out in Him in the fulness of the Godhead being presented to us in Him bodily.
H.W. Does John's ministry come in to support Paul in this connection, particularly John's gospel?
S.McC. We shall see that tomorrow. We have in mind tomorrow to refer to the glory of Christ in John's gospel and how divine affections come on to our view in His glory there. Now we come on to chapter 3 to rightly balance our time, which our beloved brother indicated in prayer, and which I am sure we need help on, to fill out the scriptures we have read. We read, of course, verses 16 - 19, we might just allude to "the body is of Christ", and then "not holding fast the head, from whom all the body, ministered to and united together by the joints and bands, increases with the increase of God". It is a great matter that we should see, and that the younger brethren should see, what the body of Christ is in this relation, the great thought of the organism, the organic side, because there is nothing saves us from independency of thought and outlook and isolationist view than this thought of the body, the body is of Christ. You remember the woman that came to the Lord and touched the hem of His garment, and the Lord was arrested immediately. He said He perceived that virtue had gone out of Him. What went out of Him went into the woman, and thus the body of Christ is formed, "the body is of Christ" in that sense.
A.H. So it says here "Let no one fraudulently
{276}
deprive you of your prize", a remarkable expression, is it not?
S.McC. It is bringing out the value of these great matters, the prize brings in what is supremely valued and, in this setting, it is the body of Christ, "the body is of Christ", and then the headship of Christ. We should be able to say something in ourselves and of ourselves as to what has come out of Christ and is in us.
E.C.M. Is the body of Christ the link with what is heavenly? We do not get that in the wilderness epistles, "the body is of Christ".
S.McC. No, it is mentioned in Colossians. We have the body of Christ in @1 Corinthians 12, but it is a figure there that is employed. When we come to the reference in Colossians, we have the reference to the substance. He is referring to the things that were a shadow of things to come, but he says, "the body (is) of Christ", that is the body is a substantial idea, it is not a theoretic or academic idea, it is a substantial idea; it is formed of what comes out of Christ, and in the body we have what is organic, organic increase, organic development.
E.J.B. Would the form of the words confirm what you were saying as to the illustration of the woman, virtue going out of the Lord when it says, "the head, from whom all the body ... increases with the increase of God", all that is in the body comes from Him?
S.McC. Just so.
A.B. Would the holding the head imply what is drawn from Him in faith? Reference has been made to the service of God in view of our sustainment before God, and then also our readings, an occasion like this, for instance, are we maintained in that way in dependence in drawing from Christ?
S.McC. Yes, it is important that we should draw from Christ in that sense, and the Spirit has a great
{277}
place in this matter. We can hardly have the organic side linked with the body without the Spirit. A brother was asking this morning as to which comes first, the head or the body. Well, of course, actually the head comes first. In the matter of experience in Romans the body is alluded to, but on historic lines the head comes first. There was a Head in heaven before there was a body on earth. The Head was in heaven and the Spirit came in the second of Acts, and the body, the assembly, was formed. You must have the Spirit for the truth of the body.
E.J.H. Is it not touching that it says of the Lord that "He looked round about to see her who had done this", @Mark 5: 32?
S.McC. Just so, and He is interested in us in that way in regard to this matter, to see her that had done this thing, and it says, she "told him all the truth". When we are affected rightly organically, as that woman in figure sets out, we shall be transparent, all the truth will come out, there will be no opaqueness, nothing to be hidden, the whole matter comes out. That is a true organic thought.
H.W. It says in @Mark 5: "she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge. And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him" (verse 30).
S.McC. Well, it is a remarkable illustration of how the body is formed from that viewpoint. We speak of the body in the light of divine counsel, for the Head and the assembly as the body is part of the purpose of God, but we want to think of it too from the moral and spiritual standpoint, how the body is formed.
A.J.G. Is that seen in verse 11 of chapter 3; I think you referred to it earlier, where it says, "wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision ... but Christ is everything, and in all". All these different features of the first man have been
{278}
displaced by the influence of Christ, and Christ is there livingly in all, is that so?
S.McC. That is it. He is everything, that is a remarkable statement, "everything, and in all".
A.H.G. Would you say a word as to the increase with the increase of God?
S.McC. That is a remarkable reference. As we know it is organic increase here. It brings out the wonderful value of the body, that is the body is quickened in the life of the Head, and you have got organic development in the body. Just as the earth, under the great derivative sources of supply in the sun's influence upon it, produces and increases, so the body, under the great influence of Christ, deriving all nourishment and supply, "increases with the increase of God". It is remarkable, it says, "the increase of God", not the increase of Christ. Have you any thought as to that?
A.H.G. No, I was just wanting help as to it. Would the thought be that there is the expression of God in this wonderful organism?
S.McC. And also it would emphasise the great interest that God has in this wonderful organism, that He is pleased, as it were, to add His increase to it, "increases with the increase of God".
P.H.H. Why is the thought of resurrection brought in? It says in chapter 2: 20, "If ye have died with Christ from the elements of the world", and then in chapter 3, "If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ". Why is that expression of position brought in now? Is it to show that this kind of thing is really beyond the power of death, but we have to keep ourselves as to mind, and affection, in that position?
S.McC. That is it, so that all we have been speaking of, and the order of things that is on our view is out of the world in character. It is the hidden side that we were referring to, and it lifts us out of
{279}
what is natural and what is social. I was impressed by a remark of Mr. Stoney's the other day, in the same article that we alluded to, he said that the social side was the most corrupting side amongst us. He was alluding to Balaam, and the way that in the transitional part of the journey of the children of Israel between the wilderness and the inheritance, that great influence came up; resurrection would take us out of all that in Colossians. We have got circumcision which is complete in the second chapter; we have resurrection which is positional and then quickening, that wonderful operation peculiarly known to the assembly, and no other family in this way, which puts us, subjectively, into correspondence with the position.
P.H.H. That is beautiful to say that "he has quickened together with him", you say that is putting us in the same position and in the same life, with Christ where He is.
S.McC. That is it, the same life, so that there is complete correspondence with Christ in the position. It is not just a position without what corresponds to it, quickening comes right in to put us subjectively in correspondence with the position.
R.G.B. Would you be free to say in that connection, a further word about Christ being our life as presented in this epistle?
S.McC. I think it is a very fine reference to the way that the Person of Christ has so come into our lives spiritually, has so endeared Himself to us through His services, His many priestly and other services, and through what He is personally, has so affected us that He can be spoken of as our life -- the Person is our life! That has a great detaching and delivering effect on us, because how could I go anywhere, how could I go into any company of people, however refined and wonderful they may be, if the One who is our life is not there. This is a very real
{280}
matter, Christ our life, it is not a statement of the purpose of God. As to the purpose of God, I point to a verse in the scripture, well that is what it says. Christ our life is a substantial reference to what the saints enjoy as found in spiritual contact with Christ.
E.J.B. Why is the day of manifestation brought in here just at that point? "When the Christ is manifested who is our life".
S.McC. It shows that He is not going to come out without us. If we will not be without Him in this world, as our life means, He is everything to us there in that wonderful temporary, transitional position, the right hand of God. He is everything to us there, we can accept the reproach and the ridicule of men in the sense of what He is to us in that way, and He is not going to come out without us.
A.J.G. Is the light of His manifestation in glory given so as to make us content to have our life hidden with Him now?
S.McC. That is it. It is to help us to accept a hidden position.
H.W. Does that incite us to move over Jordan and finally into the land?
S.McC. The whole bearing of the epistle to the Colossians in that way has in mind that we should go over in the power of attraction, and go into the inheritance. We do not go over into the inheritance by faith exactly, we go over in the power of the Spirit as attracted to Christ, the ark drawing us over, as it were, drawing us out of everything here, and Joshua becoming magnified, and then the mysterious personage coming on to our view so that Joshua takes off his shoes and worships. All that bears on the position here.
D.S.H. You were speaking about the matter of life just now, were the apostles, at the beginning of the Acts, in the appreciation of that when the angel appeared to them in the prison, and said, "Go ye
{281}
and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life", @Acts 5: 20. Did they know something of the hidden thing within, and that was to come out in expression?
S.McC. The question would be as to whether that reference to life is retroactive to what was seen in Jesus in the gospels. I think "the words of this life" that they were to make known, was linked with the ministry and service in the pathway of Jesus here in the gospels.
D.S.H. You were thinking of the matter here in Colossians as being something different from that?
S.McC. Linked with Him in glory, because our links with Him by the Spirit are in the present glorious position where He now is. Now we must just have a word as to @Ephesians 3. We read this morning in regard to His headship in the first chapter, but it is felt we should not have time to refer to it again, but now just this reference in the third chapter to the greatness of this realm where we are brought through divine operations, and where the Christ is to dwell through faith in our hearts. So that as dwelling there, as it were, having the supreme place in our affections, wherever we are, His interests are ours, all that dominates us and controls us is His outlook and His interests. It is not our businesses, not our families, not the things that are around us, but His chief interest, what is near and next His heart colours our outlook.
P.H.H. Is it like the ark in the tent which David pitched, not yet the permanent position, but the full thing there, and Christ in the ark as the centre of a great realm for God?
S.McC. That is it, "through faith" would show that we are still in conditions where finality has not been reached.
P.H.H. That is what I wondered.
S.McC. It is in your *hearts*, not in your heart.
{282}
The life is singular in Colossians, but notice "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", in this glorious realm and vast domain. We have not lost our individuality. Our individuality is still there, but Christ is dwelling, as it were, in every heart.
A.J.G. Is that seen in the woman of worth at the end of Proverbs? Was her husband dwelling in her heart by faith, working out in diligent attention to all his interests?
S.McC. Very good. How faithful she was to every interest of her husband, and the Christ dwelling in the heart involves that, that we are wholly coloured in our outlook by His interests. We need help, and I believe the Lord would help us as to this matter of our links with Christ in this glorious state by the Spirit, so that business should not have too much of a place, the Lord would help us in regard to getting lightened as to the world and the world's goods. Over against Philadelphia, Laodicea is increased with goods and Christ is outside. We want to be delivered from the spirit of inflationary times, and the spirit and power of money and material things, so as to get the full joy of knowing Christ in this relation.
A.E.M. Does verse 19 show what it is possible to know of God, even now in these mortal bodies?
S.McC. Yes, it does, how great it is, what we are privileged and what it is possible to reach by the Father's Spirit, and the Christ dwelling in our hearts, and knowing the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge. What a fine reference that is, alluding to His deity as we know, and yet His humanity is everything to us in the realm, and then it says, "that ye may be filled even to all the fulness of God". Every individuality in this glorious realm held in divine fixedness as filled to all the fulness of God.
A.H. When the apostle was leaving these brethren, he says to them, "And now I commit you to God,
{283}
and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give to you an inheritance among all the sanctified", @Acts 20: 32. Would you think in the principle of the thing, this prayer is like that?
S.McC. Very good, and I think that word "being rooted and founded in love" is embedded in that chapter; that is you can see that Paul is rooted and founded in love. It is not just a passing whim with Paul, a sudden show of love as you pass a brother or a sister, he was rooted and founded in it. So if a Eutychus falls, he is not concerned about going on with his address, he will interrupt for a moment and go down and embrace him, and resuscitate him for his life was still in him. I believe that "rooted and founded in love" is seen in that chapter, and it is a good thing for us all to take account of in our localities because we have got a lot to learn in our relations with one another, as to this matter of being "rooted and founded in love".
R.H.S. Does verse 18 help us in that way, "in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height"; I was thinking of his reference "all the saints"?
S.McC. Not one of them is out of your mind. You are not partisan, you are not thinking of a sectional idea, you are not thinking of a few, of those that you get along socially well with, or those who are of your own social level; it is "all the saints", heaven's best are in your affections.
C.W.O'L.M. What is the object in view in the saints being "filled even to all the fulness of God"?
S.McC. I think it is to show the glorious state of things in Christianity, that there is nobody there with a want in that realm, there is nobody there with something that has not been met, they are *filled* (that is the matter is complete), "to all the fulness of God". It is not *into* it, but *to* it; it is all
{284}
that God is as known in Christ in the outshining of Himself in His nature, we are filled to it.
G.H.S.P. Does it bring out the unique glory of the assembly that as the outcome of divine workmanship there is a vessel capable of containing what has come out as to God and answering to it?
S.McC. That is it, that is what we should see, the glory of divine workmanship, and how it should touch our souls that the great Divine Operator, speaking reverently, has seen that we have a place right in the centre of this vast domain of glory with Himself.
F.W.K. You referred to Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith as having an individual bearing, does "filled even to all the fulness of God" have an individual bearing?
S.McC. I think our individualities are involved in it because the prime thought in Ephesians is sonship, and sonship involves our individualities, so that every individuality is in this glorious realm contemplated with nothing lacking, "filled to all the fulness of God". The fulness of God involves infinitude as we have been taught, but we are not lost in the presence of it, we are filled to it.
A.H. And in being filled to it in this wonderful position, we are right alongside what is well-known to us, "the love of the Christ".
S.McC. Just so. It is what has engaged us every first day of the week so wondrously, and that which we have grown in the apprehension and appreciation of, we trust every first day of the week; it is right there.
J.T.S. Would the word in John's first epistle, "God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him" (chapter 4: 16), be at all like this?
S.McC. Yes, that links with what we have here.
{285}
THE GLORY OF CHRIST (5)
@John 1: 14 - 18; @John 3: 35, 36; @John 5: 19 - 23; @John 17: 22 - 26
S.McC. In referring to the glory of Christ, it seems fitting that John's gospel should come into our minds before we finish this series of meetings. John's gospel was written in view of the last days and contemplates degeneration in relation to the truth. The Person of Christ is thus peculiarly presented in the gospel as an off-set to the conditions of the last days, and especially in view of detaching us in our affections from an order of things that incurs divine displeasure, for the Jewish side is very prominent in John's gospel. I suppose religious flesh is the worst character of flesh that Scripture calls attention to; and therefore the bearing of the teaching in John's gospel is always on the way out of the world, and we see how persons are detached in John's gospel as the Person of Christ and His glory comes on to their view. From chapter 1 right through the gospel we see persons who leave one order of things and come into the order of things that is linked with the Son of God. Some are cast out as we see in chapter 9, because of the way they were affected by the glory of this Person who served them, and I have no doubt that that operates today too. We begin with the section we read in the first chapter which calls attention to the Lord Jesus Christ in the love position, and all these sections that we have read speak of the Son of God in that love position, the position of affection. We were remarking at the beginning, that in @Revelation 22 we are in the presence of one divine Person speaking to Another, along with the assembly, and saying to the Lord Jesus "Come". It is particularly affecting that in this gospel there should be brought on to our view
{286}
two divine Persons and their relations with One Another as contemplated in these scriptures, One being peculiarly the Object of attraction to the Other, as the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father would point to. I thought we might get help in conversing about these sections, so precious, in John's gospel, because the whole bearing, as I understand them, is that we might be drawn into the great environment and sphere, where such love and affection are operating. Certainly the only-begotten Son would not be a reference to Deity, although only One who had part in Deity could be the only-begotten Son, but it has a reference to the peculiar divine arrangement as J.N.D. speaks of it in "Notes and Comments", the holy covenant into which divine Persons had come in their relations with One Another. While the Spirit, of course, in some of these passages is not formally on view, yet He lies behind all, for He is the One who is inditing the record of them and He is, of course, the great binding power in the economy between divine Persons and between the saints. This passage here refers to an only-begotten with a father, which is a figure of speech in verse 14, and then in verse 18 the formal reference which is not a figure of speech, but an actual reference, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father" is surely calculated to affect us, particularly, I think, in view of the service of God in the assembly. Terms of richness and substance should thus enter into it, as by the Spirit we are formed intelligently in the light of these wondrous relations between the holy Persons of the Trinity.
G.H.S.P. You remarked in the second reading that Hebrews was probably written just before the overthrow of Jerusalem, are we right in thinking that this gospel was written after that? Is that at all significant as the Spirit brings the imperishable glory of the Son of God forward, and this love position
{287}
in contrast to the breakdown of what might be official?
S.McC. I think that is the whole point of John's gospel. The answer to departure from the truth and degeneracy in it and its terms, the setting up of creeds, and rite and ceremony all around, is what we have here. Love really is the answer to all, for love never fails, and love is projected on to our view between divine Persons, so that we might be affected by what goes through unimpaired by whatever comes into the dispensation.
M.J. Did you refer to the blessed Spirit as the link between the Father and the Son?
S.McC. Well, we know that the oneness that is referred to in the latter section of this gospel must bring the Spirit in, because, as F.E.R., J.T., and others pointed out, the Father and the Son are One in the unity of the Spirit. In the economy which comes on to our view these holy Persons are viewed as bound up together in this holy love that is referred to with such mutual regard for One Another in it. All this is calculated to affect us in its reaction in our souls as to our relations with one another, as to whether unjealous love exists between one another, as to whether the mutual conditions of holy love, seen between the Persons of the Trinity in the economy, exists between us as brethren. I think it does in measure, but I think there is always room for improvement in it.
R.G.B. Is there a link with the great love section in @Genesis 22 - 24, where we have a suggestion, in the types, of the consideration of divine Persons for One Another, and the realm of reciprocal love in which divine Persons are moving together?
S.McC. I think that is one of the richest sections typically that we have in the Old Testament that points us to this great matter. What references we have in the type there to God's Fatherhood in
{288}
Abraham and Christ's Sonship in Isaac in such terms of love as are referred to in that section.
S.H.N. Do the company at Bethany which we get in chapter 11 speak of that reflection of this scene of love amongst those who have been moved by the attraction and greatness and grace of Christ?
S.McC. So that the chapter opens with great references to Christ's affection for those in Bethany and that comes out in the depth of their sorrow, when it says that Jesus shed tears, for the real force of the word 'wept' is that Jesus shed tears, and they said, "Behold how he loved him!" (chapter 11: 36). That is there is a testimony, an evidence publicly of His affection for those in Bethany, so I think it links with the section that has been referred to, for it is into that section that Rebecca comes. The assembly comes into a realm of spirituality where the divine economy comes so peculiarly on to our view in the Father and the Son, seen in type in Abraham and Isaac, and the Spirit in the steward of Abraham's house.
E.B.S. You referred to the Spirit having part in all these passages. Would it be right to think more of the pleasure of the blessed Spirit in the relation of Father and Son?
S.McC. Well, it is to impress upon us the economy in that sense, the unjealous way in which divine Persons serve One Another. What a model for us, what a lesson for us, would that our spirits drank more into the spirit of it, the unjealous relations between the Holy Persons in the holy covenant that comes on to our view in this gospel!
L.W.B. Would there be a way in which the contemplation in verse 14, would greatly help us; His glory is for our contemplation, but as to His fulness, we receive it?
S.McC. I think so. I think that is the way we are affected so that it is particularly interesting to
{289}
see that Rebecca comes into this wonderful section in Genesis, the richest section that we have in the Old Testament, along with what comes out in David and Solomon, but particularly rich in Genesis in God's Fatherhood in type in Abraham, and Christ's Sonship in type in Isaac.
A.H.G. Would that be in mind in chapter 3, "He that has the bride is the bridegroom" (verse 29)?
S.McC. It is interesting how that indirect reference to the bride comes into this section. You do not get that reference in the synoptic gospels. In the synoptic gospels we get the great provision made, the wedding feast of the king for the son, but no mention of the bride, but when you come to John's gospel, the bride is introduced, although we might ask, where is the bride?
W.McK. Have you got in mind, that in the introduction of the assembly, there is a creature vessel now, as capable of responding to these holy affections in the Father and the Son?
S.McC. Yes, and that love is not only to be contemplated by the assembly, but it is to operate in the assembly because the Lord says in the last verse that we read, "that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". That shows how the assembly comes into this great matter, and how that love is to operate in the assembly. It is to operate in relation to our houses, it is to operate in our local meetings, and it is to operate in the assembly generally.
C.M.M. Would the declaration of God from the place of love, involve that if we are to know that God, it must be by way of love? We cannot learn to know that God theologically.
S.McC. That is very important because that has been where the great error has come into the dispensation. In the early church councils over theological matters, in their desire, as they thought, to preserve
{290}
the truth, they set it and encased it in the creeds, and the result was, of course, that error came into it. The truth can never be preserved on theological lines, and this verse 18 helps us to see how the knowledge of God, as He has come out in Christ, is to be apprehended.
J.W.D. Is the thought of "I in you", the Lord's scope in the assembly; is this the beginning in this chapter 1?
S.McC. I think we have to take the whole gospel, viewing it as written in view of the last days, as affecting the assembly from beginning to end in that way that the Lord contemplates being in the assembly as known and apprehended in this light.
E.C.M. Would it be right to say that the understanding of the declaration of God lays the basis in our souls for worship?
S.McC. How could we worship God rightly apart from the knowledge of Himself in that sense as declared or revealed?
R.H.S. What is the bearing of the witness of John coming into this section?
S.McC. I think it is to help us in regard to what has run through our meetings, that we should be detached from ourselves and our own importance. It says, "John bears witness", it is a bracketed remark, you will notice, as if it is something introduced that was not originally in the writer's mind. "John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me". I think if the constitution of John marked us we would not give much trouble to one another, or in the assembly.
A.C.S.P. Does the reference in @John 17, "thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" show how what is so great is brought within our range in this medium of love?
{291}
S.McC. Just so, because while we cannot enter into absolute conditions, being of creature understanding and capacity, yet there is a link between what is absolute and relative, and the link is in this great thought of love, the love that is seen here.
E.J.B. Is this added touch in verse 18 as over against verse 14, "who is in the bosom of the Father" very affecting?
S.McC. It is, indeed. As you would know, the word 'bosom' in the original conveys the thought of a receptacle, that is the word carries the thought of receiving, and the preposition 'in', "who is *in*", is "eis", which, in the original, has the force of 'motion towards'. The reciprocity in the verse, the mutual relations conveyed in the verse, is thus very affecting. It is not only that the Lord Jesus moved into that place in coming into manhood, but that the Father's affections received Him. Think of the joy of God in this paternal relation, receiving Christ in humanity in this wonderful place of affection.
J.T.S. Mr. Taylor said many years ago, that it was a received place and one felt that it prepared us for the reception of the truth as to the Lord's sonship.
S.McC. Just so. Mr. Taylor pointed out, you will remember, that the prepositions in the first chapter of John's gospel were like a sword turning every way to protect the Person of Christ.
J.T.S. In connection with the remark you made as to the knowledge of God not being preserved in creeds, it says, "He that loves not has not known God; for God is love", @1 John 4: 8. The knowledge of God is where love is, are you saying?
S.McC. That is it, and the measure of our spirituality, as you would know better than I do, is the measure in which we are formed in love. I mean especially with those of us who serve in any capacity, there is no use thinking our ability is the measure of our spirituality, because it is not. You may have a
{292}
most unspiritual man with gift and ability, but not formed in love. The measure of the spirituality of any one of us and of the ministers, is the measure in which we are formed in love.
J.T.S. So that conversely if I "have not love, I am nothing", @1 Corinthians 13: 2?
S.McC. Just so.
R.G.B. Do we have to learn love at its source in seeing these holy relations of love between the Persons and are we formed in love as we are drawn into the sphere of love in an increasing way?
S.McC. I think so. We get the pure stream of it here, flowing between the Father and the Son and the Spirit in it, because we cannot, in our thoughts, elect the Spirit out of this. The Spirit is in this holy matter, although reference is not made to Him, but it is pointing to the wonderful divine arrangement in the economy.
A.H.G. And this is what we come into as detached from the world.
S.McC. Exactly. Where would you find the knowledge and enjoyment of this? You would only find it in persons detached from the world, and this knowledge is not only to enter into the high levels of assembly service, but it is to enter into our houses in our relations with our wives, and vice versa in our relations with our husbands, and as fathers in our relations with our children, and mothers too, and children in their relations with their parents. All this is to enter into and affect these settings.
J.W.D. How would it work out?
S.McC. In deliverance from legality, and all the bondage-engendering elements of it. There is nothing stifles spirituality more than legality amongst us, do you not think?
S.H.N. Is it suggested in the home to which the Lord could commit His mother?
S.McC. It is very fine to see that. John is the
{293}
one to whom the Lord committed His mother at the end of the gospel, the Lord attended to every matter. He attended to matters that the scripture might be fulfilled, but He attended to other matters that the scripture does not refer to, such as the incident you allude to, as He commits her to John, John the one who is writing this, John who lay on the bosom of Jesus. The Lord commits His mother to John, and John took her to his own home, not to someone else's home; he took her to his own home.
W.McK. Is there in that sense, in view of the spirit of apostasy coming in, a need for a certain protective element around these holy matters?
S.McC. That is what I am thinking of very specially in referring to our houses.
W.McK. I was thinking of what it says in verse 14, "And the Word became flesh, and dwelt *among* us", as if there was a certain protective element around these things.
S.McC. Tabernacled *among* us, how very affecting that is! In the Acts it says, "all the time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us", chapter 1: 21. It is very affecting to think of the Lord in the practical conditions of life amongst the disciples. He ate at the same table with them, He ate out of the same dishes with them. We speak reverently and soberly, but in those circumstances there was the testimony to eternal life. That is an order of life that the spirit of this world or the power of death in it could never touch.
A.W.P. Has the apostle Paul got these thoughts that you are speaking of when he touches the marital relationship in @Ephesians 5, and uses the word 'own'?
S.McC. You mean, "Husbands, love your own wives", @Ephesians 5: 25. That is a great matter, you do not want to love someone else's wife, you want to love your own wife. It is a very humbling thing if
{294}
a brother thinks more of somebody else's wife than he does of his own wife. So Paul stresses that we are to love our *own* wives, but what is in Paul's mind is, "I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly" (verse 32).
S.E.W. What about the environment of chapter 12? It is Bethany, it does not say where exactly, but "Bethany, where was the dead man Lazarus" (verse 1).
S.McC. That shows you how we have persons in a locality affected by the peculiar attractiveness of Christ. "The only-begotten Son", it is the peculiar attractiveness of Christ. It is not the Father, it is not the Spirit, Christ is the only-begotten Son. We could not carry these thoughts into Deity, it is a question of the divine arrangement into which God has come that we should know Him and know love, "hereby we have known love". How have we known it? We have known it through this divine arrangement in that He laid down His life for us.
S.E.W. So does the whole divine arrangement take character from this place in chapter 1: 18?
S.McC. It shows us what the very centre of that arrangement is, the Father and the Son are referred to so peculiarly in it, and then the Spirit bringing all this on to our view, because it is the Spirit who does that.
R.H.S. So does the Spirit feelingly bring the Father and the Son into our view in these verses read in chapter 3? "The Father loves the Son and has given all things to be in his hand". Would the Spirit feelingly bring that before us?
S.McC. Yes. He does, that is we come to the words of John the evangelist in chapter 3. John the baptist has been speaking about the greatness and glory of Christ as coming from above, and after John finishes, the Spirit of God, through John the evangelist, immediately refers to "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things to be in *his* hand".
{295}
Now the focal point was the bosom of the Father in the first passage, and the only-begotten Son in it, now the focal point is the hand of the Son, that the Father loves the Son and has put all things into that position in the Son, the hand of the Son.
G.H.S.P. It speaks there of the Spirit descending and abiding on Christ. Does not that peculiarly bring out the pleasure of the Spirit in the manhood and glory of Christ? Is it not affecting that that Person, the Spirit, is still with us, the very same Person who descended and abode on Jesus?
S.McC. Exactly. How affecting it is to take account of that section! The very words, "the Spirit descending as a dove" (verse 32), fits in with the great restfulness of the thought, "the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father", as if the Spirit is coming in to mark it off, that is the point. This refers to what the Lord says in @John 6, "for him has the Father sealed, even God" (verse 27). This is the sealing here as the Spirit comes in and descends as a dove upon Him.
E.J.B. So it is notable that the verses you have read at the end of chapter 3 are preceded by a reference to the measureless giving of the Spirit.
S.McC. Very striking, is it not, because it shows how important the Spirit is in this regard. And not only does the reference to the measureless giving in regard to the Spirit precede, but what follows is a wonderful opening up of the truth in regard to the Spirit as the living water.
A.H.G. In this matter of the "all things" given into His hands, would that include also the circumstances of the believer? I was thinking especially of @John 11, for instance.
S.McC. I think all that would enter into it, although there are certain things that are reserved; that is, we would have to take the scriptures in their context and bearing. For instance, the Lord says
{296}
later on that not even He knows the times and the seasons, they are in the Father's hands. That is rather remarkable, but it is all to bring out the glory of the economy of love into which the Persons have come, Two of Them subject to Another. It is remarkable in that way, but I think the "all things" here in the working out of the administration would involve the scene at Bethany.
J.T.S. Would it imply what the Lord is saying in the next chapter, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water" (chapter 4: 10)? Would that enter into the all things?
S.McC. I think so, that would be one of the prime things. The gift of the Spirit is one of the prime things in mind in the administration that comes on to our view in this divine arrangement, and then the fact that it is a woman. We have been referring to Rebecca coming into the wonderful arrangement between Isaac and the son and the servant; well, it is striking that immediately we get @John 4, we get a woman coming into this wonderful arrangement. Not only to contemplate the economy or the arrangement, but she becomes part of the arrangement herself.
S.E.W. Could I refer to a verse I have been impressed with all these readings, "And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac. And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward to the east country", @Genesis 25: 5, 6? Does it suggest the merging of Rebecca?
S.McC. You mean the sons of the concubines are sent away. Any alien influence or alien feature that would detract from the glory of Isaac is removed from the position. Is that what you have in mind?
S.E.W. Yes, I have been impressed with it all the readings.
{297}
S.McC. Well, detachment has been the thought running through all these meetings, detachment is not just by legal principles enforced, but by the power of affection for Christ, and every lover of Christ will have regard for the commandments of Christ. He will never depart from the commandments of Christ, as the Lord indicates later.
S.R. Would that be seen in the 10th chapter where the attractiveness of the shepherd leads the sheep out of the system?
S.McC. Just so, that is He goes before them, and His sheep follow. We had a good lot this morning, in the meeting where one was, about the sheep. Christ's love for the sheep and the sheep knowing Him, and following Him, and that is very affecting and is really a test to all of us, as to whether we are really Christ's sheep, because the reference to Christ's sheep in John's gospel is not to a nominal position, that we might be in, it is a reference to the characteristics and constitution of persons who hear and listen to, and are subject to Christ's word, the voice of the shepherd.
L.G.B. So do we need to understand that John's sheep are not straying sheep, but intelligent sheep?
S.McC. Yes. Well, this matter of the women and the worship of God as coming into this next section, following the reference to the Father loving the Son, and giving all things to be in his hand, is important as showing us how one of the prime things in relation to the subject in John's gospel is how the assembly comes into it, because I believe John's gospel has in mind from beginning to end, Philadelphia. That is how the assembly comes into these holy wondrous matters and stands in them responding to the heart of Christ as appreciating the things that are so near His heart.
R.G.B. So is it like the administration set up under David and Solomon resulting in the establishment
{298}
of the service of God in glory in the assembly?
S.McC. That is it.
J.W.D. And is the rapidity the same today, a possibility?
S.McC. Well, I should think it is. In fact John's gospel having in mind our own times would emphasise that. What do you say about it?
J.W.D. I think it calls for more faith in the ability of divine Persons to effect Their will if we are subject.
S.McC. I think where we are tested, do you not think, is in regard to subjection, whether we are subject to the Son, the One who has all things in His hand. What tested the Jews was the Son, and things given into His hand; they thought that things were in their hands as they one time were, whose are the covenants, the glory, the adoption, but now there has been a transfer into the hands of the Son, and the Jews are tested, and we know that they have to go out as the Jews will always have to go out when it comes to this matter.
R.H.S. Why is it that in chapter 4, in answer to the woman's request, the Lord says, "the water which I shall give *him*", He does not say, the water which I shall give you, but "the water which I shall give *him* shall become in *him* a fountain of water"?
S.McC. Because it is an abstract allusion that the Lord is making. He is saying, "Every one", He is speaking to her directly, but He is drawing attention to an abstract thought, "Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life". The believer is in mind in that sense.
W.McK. You referred to Philadelphia, do you think that John's gospel would show us what enters into the constitution of the overcomer in Philadelphia?
{299}
You referred to constitution yesterday as a very important matter.
S.McC. I think it does. So that you can understand in the light of what F.E.R. said, that John saw what Paul never saw, how his gospel would take colour from that, bearing in mind that the Spirit is inspiring the holy record. John is writing under the influence of the Spirit, but you can see his gospel would take character from that, that he saw what Paul never saw, that is saints in revival standing in the truth of the assembly as Philadelphia contemplates, and his gospel would have that in mind all the way through.
E.C.M. Does Philadelphia in that way stand for the very best in the way of quality and spiritual refinement?
S.McC. That is it, and that is why quality is stressed in John's gospel, the quality of the relations between the Father and the Son, and the Spirit, moved on to our view, and then the quality of the worship, and the worshippers, "the Father seeks such as his worshippers". It is the quality of the worshippers -- "the Father seeks *such*".
H.A.H. Is the extension of lovability seen? Whilst specifically in the Son, is it seen in Philadelphian conditions, the lovability that can be entrusted with administration?
S.McC. Well, that is what is in mind. Philadelphia means brotherly love, so that really it is a love letter that we have in the word to Philadelphia, the Lord is so pleased with what He sees there as the assembly comes under His eye in the features that stand out, and it is all linked with the quality of the love that John is referring to in his gospel. That brings us to chapter 5, where the word 'love' is different from the word 'love' in chapter 3. In chapter 3 "The Father loves the Son", the word 'love' is 'agapao' -- the word of settled disposition,
{300}
but the word in chapter 5: 20, is 'phileo' -- the love of attractiveness, the love of friendship, and you get that in Philadelphia. It is not only the thought of the settled disposition of love, but the attractive features that draw out the love of Christ in Philadelphia. This has in mind the operational side here.
E.J.B. Why does it go on to quickening in that setting?
S.McC. I think it is very important because we can never be rightly in the service of God apart from quickening. Quickening involves the divine operation by which we are affected subjectively and brought into correspondence with Christ. It is not a question of what we know, it is not a question of what faith can take in, quickening is never viewed by faith, quickening is by the Spirit. It is how the believer through the sovereign divine operation in him is put subjectively into correspondence with Christ.
E.C.M. Mr. Raven's remark as to quickening helps in that connection, the quickening power of God fits me in sensibilities to live in the closest relationship with God. Is that not in mind, the relationship in John, and quickening essential to it?
S.McC. So that the quickening helps us to be at home in all the refinement and quality that is seen in the relations of the Father and the Son, "For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does"; that is very affecting, that One divine Person should come into a position where He is shown things because the Father loves Him in relation to the great operations that are at hand.
J.W.D. Is quickening permanent, is it once and for all?
S.McC. I think so in its bearing, but we need to be sustained in the gain of it, do you not think?
J.W.D. I was wondering whether this word 'constitutional' would mean a great deal more than Lord's day morning.
{301}
S.McC. I think it does. We need more help to see that it is not only a question of what we are on Lord's day morning, but a question of what we are all the time. With the Lord Jesus there was not any difference between what He was in the temple, and what He was outside in His relations with men, the holiness was the same, and so it should be with the saint, with the believers.
E.B.S. Would you say another word on the Father *giving* these things to the Son, and "all things" in chapter 3, and "all judgment" in chapter 5? He *has* given, it says, in both cases.
S.McC. It is helpful to see this here now that you have referred to it, because we were referring to certain limitations in connection with the Son that He did not know, as He says, in a certain relation, not even the Son knows. Now we come to certain limitations linked with the Father. It is a remarkable thing and it should help those that think that the thought of the Father covers everything because it does not. The thought of the Father is a limited thought, as it says here, "for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son", that is, the Father does not judge any one.
E.B.S. Is it a certain limitation by His own doing, would you say?
S.McC. Every limitation seen in relation to a divine Person is through His own voluntary action. It never could be otherwise, whether it is the Father or the Son, or the Spirit.
E.B.S. Does that not help us to understand it?
S.McC. Well, it does. We can never bind upon any divine Person a limitation which He voluntarily assumes and takes on Himself.
R.G.B. Does not that make the thought of the arrangement that you referred to earlier, the covenant into which divine Persons have entered, a very wonderful and attractive thought?
{302}
S.McC. Well, it does indeed, and especially the unselfishness in it. How we need to learn the unselfishness of love as seen in the divine arrangement! We are so selfish, so self-centred naturally; how this would affect us, so that when we come to @John 17, we see the blessedness of the covenant, that is the arrangement, the covenant as J.N.D. alludes to it, the bond between the holy Persons in the divine arrangement. How lovely it is, as we see it in @John 17, as the Lord speaks to the Father, and then the subject of the speaking is the saints. The chapter begins with the thought of eternal life, and ends with the thought of sonship, and in between these two outstanding features of blessing in the dispensation, the Lord is speaking to the Father about the assembly, about the saints.
J.T.S. Just in passing, would you mind saying one word as to the Father quickening, and the Son quickening and the Spirit quickening in chapter 6?
S.McC. Well, all the holy Persons have part in the matter of quickening. The Spirit will have part in the quickening of our bodies, according to @Romans 8, one of the last features of the operation of the Spirit, in regard to our present temporary condition, will be the quickening of our bodies.
S.H.N. Could you say something as to the character of this glory which is given to Him, and which He has given to us?
S.McC. Well, that brings in the great thought of sonship, the glory of sonship, "the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one; I in them, and thou in me". How fine this is as showing the unjealous, holy relation between the Persons, the perfect state of love implied. How could Persons be in one another unless you have a perfect state of love?
R.H.S. What is the force in this connection, first of all "that the world may *believe* that thou hast
{303}
sent me", and then "that the world may *know* that thou hast sent me"?
S.McC. Well, it is looking on to the millennial day, of course, when there will be the great testimony rendered in public display as to where these matters have stood in relation to the Lord's service, and the bringing in of the saints. The world will know where the whole matter stands, and the believing is an abstract thought again.
R.H.S. I wondered if there was behind it, the thought of oneness being a matter of power in relation to testimony to the world.
S.McC. Well, it involves that. That is our holy concern in regard to the brethren in their approach to the government, that there should be oneness among them. How can we approach the public side of things in testimony unless there is oneness amongst us? It immediately brings in weakness where there is diversified thought and opinion in regard to matters in approach to the public position in the testimonial setting.
A.H.G. Would this perfect state of love you have referred to, underlie this matter of oneness?
S.McC. Well, it does, because it involves unjealous relations, and we do not need to draw away from this matter of unjealous relations, because we know that naturally in our hearts, there is a good deal of jealousy, and it has to be judged and kept where it belongs.
L.W.B. Would that be the answer to much of our difficulty about detachment? If the thoughts of Heaven were current in our souls, the question would be solved, would it not?
S.McC. Well, just so. So that the chapter finishes with the wonderful reference to the Father: "And I have made known to them thy name, and will make it known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them". Think of how the Lord would whet their desire, in the "will make
{304}
it known". He had spoken to them about the Father, that crowning feature of our dispensation, the name by which God is specially known in our dispensation, the name of Father, the choiceness of it, and the sweetness of it. He says, "I have made known to them thy name", but then He says, "and will make it known"; involving what is wider and greater as the whole divine arrangement would affect us in relation to what He says, "my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God", chapter 20: 17.
J.T.S. You do not make the "will make it known" the name anything less than what you have just referred to?
S.McC. No. It has in mind that we should reach God in the fulness in which He is known, as we know Them by the names They have taken in the divine arrangement, God known in Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
W.McK. Does the last reference in the chapter to "the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them", refer to the assembly coming into the economy in an active sense?
S.McC. That is what I had in mind in referring in the type to how Rebecca comes into it, and how the assembly comes into it now, that that love, the quality of it, is in the assembly. And it is not only that, but the Lord says, "I in them", particularly linking on with "my new name", and "in the midst of the assembly will I sing thy praises", @Hebrews 2: 12. That is what it has in mind.
{305}
THE LEADER AND COMPLETER OF FAITH
A. J. Gardiner
@Hebrews 12: 1 - 10
In thinking over, dear brethren, what we had before us this afternoon, this passage came into my mind, there being an obvious link in the fact that in chapter 2, as we were having, we have the Lord presented to us as the Leader of our salvation, and here He is presented as "the leader and completer of faith". It is very affecting that we have the light that God is bringing many sons to glory. I suppose glory is the full shining out of God in His blessedness, and the perfect answer to it on the part of men in sonship, and that is what God is bringing us to, and Christ is Himself the Leader of our salvation, the One who has in His own Person in Manhood set the matter on, and is now the full expression in glorious manhood in sonship in the presence of God of that which we are to be brought to. Indeed, it will even extend to complete conformity to His body of glory. The pattern is there already in the presence of God in the Person of our Lord Jesus Christ in glorious conditions, and we are all called with a heavenly calling to this glorious end of sons brought to glory.
Well now, the writer of the epistle speaks in this chapter of the cloud of witnesses surrounding us, witnesses to the great principle of walking by faith not by sight. I believe there is nothing more important for us in one sense than to recognise that we are to be governed by faith, and when I say faith, I am
{306}
not speaking simply of confidence in God, which is an element really of piety, but of faith, that is, having unseen things before the soul. It says in Corinthians that the inward man, even though the outward is perishing, is renewed day by day on the principle of our looking not at seen things but at unseen things, and if that is the desire of our hearts, the bent of our minds, then I believe we can count on the help of the Spirit. The Spirit will link Himself with faith in the saints. On the other hand, if we are spending our time looking at seen things we shall place a great obstacle in the way of the help which the Spirit would afford us.
And so here we are encouraged to lay aside every weight "and sin which so easily entangles us". Each one, I suppose, as desiring to go on with God, discovers the kind of thing that is a weight or hindrance, or that tends to be an entanglement. These things are to be laid aside. It is important that we should be concerned to do so, that we should have energy to do so. Abraham had energy to scare away certain birds. We are all to show energy in divine things, and the Spirit of God will help, and the grace of the Lord will help where there is the evidence of desire and energy on the part of the saints. So we are to lay aside "every weight, and sin which so easily entangles us", and, it says, to "run with endurance the race that lies before us, looking steadfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith". He has led in this way, the path of faith, a path through this world, governed by the light of unseen things, and He has completed the course. He is the Completer of faith, and He is set down, it says, "at the right hand of the throne of God". So that there is every encouragement in looking steadfastly on Jesus.
We were thinking this afternoon of it being befitting to God "for whom are all things, and by whom are
{307}
all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings". It is a most touching thing, sufferings are incidental to the path of faith of the believer, but the Leader of our salvation has been perfected, that is, has arrived at the full thought in which our salvation is set forth in Him, through sufferings. Wonderful grace indeed that the Lord should go through on that principle, not avoiding suffering. It says sufferings, in the plural, not simply suffering as a general principle, though that holds good, but the detail of the sufferings. How much entered into it! I suppose the Lord was conscious of suffering in His spirit and in other ways all through His path of testimony here, but when it came to the last few days and the last few hours, how much was concentrated in that period! But He went through, it says, "who, in view of the joy lying before him, endured the cross, having despised the shame". How we all shrink from shame, we all shrink from reproach. I do not suppose there is anyone who does not. At the same time the Lord is presented to us, not as shrinking from it, but as enduring the cross and despising the shame.
And so we find that the writer of the epistle brings in then the thought of the dealings of God with His sons. What an encouragement that is, dear brethren. There is such a thing as the Father's chastening, there is even such a thing as the Father's scourging, which is more severe, at the same time all comes from a Father's hand, and all is because sonship is in view for us, and because the pattern of what God is bringing His sons to is already before Him in its glorious completeness in Christ. Let us then keep it before *us*. That is what God is bringing us to, full conformity to Christ, morally at the present time, and when the work in our souls is completed, then conformity to Christ in His body of glory. But the most important
{308}
thing, of course, is conformity to Christ morally which the Father of spirits is operating in view of in each one of us.
And so the writer says that we are to consider well: "consider well" -- as though he would detain us on the point, not just a fleeting passing view, "consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself, that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds". What an important matter the mind is, dear brethren; how easily we may allow in our minds unbelieving thoughts or discouraging thoughts, but he says "that ye be not weary, fainting in your minds". The great point is that the mind should be held in the right direction. And so it says, "looking steadfastly on Jesus the leader and completer of faith". Not only the detail of the path of faith in all its testings and all that calls for endurance passed through by Him, but glorious completeness apprehended in Himself as set down at the right hand of the throne of God. And so it says we are to "consider well him who endured so great contradiction from sinners against himself", and then further, "Ye have quite forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when reproved by him; for whom the Lord loves he chastens". How encouraging all this is, dear brethren. It is a question of love, and of the pleasure of God. It says, "it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory". It is a question of the delight that God contemplates in having us all before Him in the glorious liberty of sonship and in the glory attaching to it rightly as already set forth in Christ. There can be no greater glory for us to contemplate than the final climax of that to which we have been called and to which we are being brought, and this is the time of formation. How much there is to form
{309}
in us, and a good deal to be set aside. We have been speaking, dear brethren, of being liberated from things down here, things that are unworthy of those who are partakers of a heavenly calling. The bride is in view -- of course, that is not the aspect here, it is sons in view here, but the bride is in view too, one who is in every way adorned with that which speaks of real moral worth as taking character from Christ, and therefore suited to be with Him as answering to His heart. Here it is a question of sons who will answer to the Father's heart, who will minister pleasure to Him. And so there is all that on the one hand, this example of the path of Jesus, and on the other hand the present faithful patient dealing of the Father as the Father of spirits. It is a good thing to keep that in mind, dear brethren. We sometimes tend to be unduly occupied, it may be, with our bodies. That may be the tendency with us, and, of course, our bodies are of value, they belong to the Lord, they are necessary for the expression of what is of God, and for the expression of what is right in man God-ward, but at the same time the great thing is our spirits. Think of the spirit that was found with the Lord Jesus when He said, "Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit" (@Luke 23: 46), and then the spirit that was in Stephen when he said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit", @Acts 7: 59. We might say with Stephen it was a perfected spirit, and that is what the Father is after with us, perfected spirits. He is the Father of spirits, it says, "shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?"
Well, beloved brethren, there is plenty of pressure today, pressure in the individual circumstances of the saints, pressure too in assembly matters, but all these things under the hand of the Father, are ordered and controlled by Him in perfect skill. There is, as we have had pointed out to us many times, such a
{310}
thing as the *balancing* of the clouds, as though all is held in perfect wisdom and perfect skill, by the One who is working with every one of us in view of this great matter of His bringing many sons to glory. And so it says, "Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?" And the end in mind is that we should become partakers of His holiness.
Only one word and I close, and that is, reverting again to the verse in the second chapter, where it says, "it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things ...". That is most affecting, "by whom", not only for Him, but by Him. I believe we can see more and more that in all that has come in through the presence of sin and all that is attendant upon it. God is working out His own thoughts and His own pleasure in the saints, but it is by means of entering into those conditions Himself, either in the Person of the Son or in the Person of the Spirit. It is a very blessed thing thus to get that view of God, that not only are all things for Him, but they are also by Him, and we ourselves are among those who are the subjects of His gracious faithful working in view of this wonderful calling, that He is bringing many sons to glory to be before Him for ever in the likeness of Christ morally and bodily.
Well, may the Lord encourage us then in the present pressures to understand what is in view in them, and as subject to the Father of spirits to be with God in all His ways so that He may reach with every one of us the end He has in view.

SUFFERINGS
P. H. Hardwick
@Exodus 17: 4 - 7; @Exodus 30: 22 - 30; @Acts 16: 23 - 25
I have today received a fresh impression of sufferings, based on the verses we have read in @Hebrews 2: 10, and I would just record this brief impression amongst the brethren, as referring to these scriptures. First of all in @Exodus 17, according to the type, the Spirit is given to us on the basis of the sufferings of Christ. We are well acquainted with the other rock in @Numbers 20, a high rock, speaking of Christ in His exaltation and glory, and the necessity only of speaking to that rock that it may give its water, but it does us good to remember this earlier reference. We may often forget it, that is, the Spirit given to us on the basis of Christ being smitten. As to the figures which the scripture uses, this would involve what is inscrutable, because God Himself was there. He tells Moses what he is to do, taking with him some elders who were to see and to take experience by what was happening, and taking the rod; then God says, "I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb". That is, whether it be in Christ, or whether it be in the Spirit, God Himself is there, fully identified with the coming in of the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit, God fully there in Christ, God fully there in the Spirit. If we should ask ourselves, Does this mean then that God Himself has entered into the suffering such as the smiting signifies? Indeed it is so, and Scripture helps to hold the thought right in saying, "Now the rock was the Christ". And this makes this particular incident a very touching one to us, that we should receive the Spirit on such a basis, that Christ has suffered and died, "Christ once humbled here". The grace of it is magnified, too, when we think what called it forth
{312}
there was murmuring and refusal, the refusal of divine authority in lordship as represented in Moses. But God does not strike the people. Somebody had to be smitten, somebody had to suffer if God was to go on with the people, and He meets it all in surpassing grace, not only in the actual smiting of the rock but in the giving of the Spirit. The words Massah, and Meribah merit our contemplation and our deep pondering, for we may come to the conclusion that God has many times met our own contention and our own quarrelling by means of reminding us of the One who suffered even unto death that we might have the Spirit.
And then I thought of the anointing oil in chapter 30, and the contents of it, as it says when God is approaching this great matter of the hallowing by the anointing, "Take best spices -- of liquid myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon the half -- two hundred and fifty, and of sweet myrtle two hundred and fifty, and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin". It was wonderful that Moses should receive an instruction of that kind. He had not yet come down the mountain, this was still all light for him, light from the direct presence of God which he was to pass on presently to the people, but it must have struck him as it would ourselves, knowing the general scope of Scripture, that the myrrh, the liquid myrrh being the first ingredient and being a not inconsiderable part of the composition of that holy ointment, would mean that suffering was in view, anointing in view of suffering is to be included in that holy composition. It is true that fragrance is there, myrtle and cinnamon and cassia, and the myrrh itself, there was always something of the sweet fragrance which the Spirit brings, and every time, we might say, the Spirit is presented as anointing, and every time we are conscious that anointed persons or a part of the anointed system is
{313}
before us, occupying us, we shall be conscious of fragrance. It is to be noted too that these are spices. They are not minerals, they are not rocks ground to powder and mixed, they are spices; that is to say, they are a part of the growth which God Himself has ordered, they come straight from God. So, dear brethren, in what occupies us in our place in the wilderness and in the testimony, and in what our brother has just been speaking to us about, our part in chastening and all that comes with it, there is to be a compensating help and sweetness from the Spirit. That is, that the Spirit especially needed in times of suffering and times of pressure, is first, we might say, before our minds as in connection with suffering itself. The myrrh is mentioned first. We shall remember a woman who brought a box of myrrh and lavished it on the Lord, we shall remember the occasions in the Song of Songs where myrrh, and liquid myrrh, is mentioned, principally in settings which show that there is suffering and pressure. I think we are just to be encouraged at this present time that the Holy Spirit Himself as the anointing enters in for our help in all these times of testing for the saints. The whole of the tabernacle system was to be anointed, the persons, as in Aaron and his sons, and the whole system, so that whether taken down or re-erected, every part of the pathway, involving much suffering, in what Moses called this "waste howling wilderness", every feature of testing was to be accompanied by some precious detail of the help and power of the Spirit. I believe that the Holy Spirit Himself would enter into this and would encourage us. Peter tells us, "If ye are reproached in the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you". If any suffer in the name of Christ, not on account of it exactly, but if we are in that position to which the name of Christ attaches, the Spirit has a particular
{314}
interest; not only in the whole assembly system, we might say, but in every person who is pressed "as a Christian" in regard of the truth in this time of travail and pilgrimage. So, dear brethren, without saying more, may I just leave this impression? It is very wonderful, at least to my soul, that, according to the figures used, Christ should enter into suffering that we might have the Spirit, and in what accompanies the composition of the anointing oil, speaking of the Spirit Himself, there is suffering also attached. This will help us in view of finishing our journey, and finishing it according to God.
An example of this, I believe, would be in @Acts 16, when our dear brethren were suffering and their backs were beaten, yet they were soon praising, "in praying, were praising God". There was a change. One is always looking for changes amongst the people of God, specially amongst the young people, and amongst those too who have gone out of the way, in fact, with all of us, that we may come more and more to God's own way and God's own thoughts, beautifully exemplified in these two, Paul and Silas, in praying. I dare say in praying they were accepting the suffering and full of desire in regard of the will of God. We cannot tell, but that it should be turned into praise shows that there was another power there, a power which did not arise from Paul and Silas naturally, but which arose, I believe, from the Spirit with them; the sufferings of Christ were exemplified there, although, of course, only in small measure, but the Spirit identified Himself with these suffering men. Some of our brethren are suffering in many ways, we need not detail them, but there is a resource, a rich outlet in this divine provision. Some of the things in the tabernacle economy had to be beaten. We are to think of it morally, gold had to be beaten, for instance, beaten out very thin, for the ephod of the high priest, gold beaten out and cut
{315}
into very thin lacings. God could not use anything that was not beaten, He could not use an ingot of gold, however precious, it must be beaten. That refers to what is beaten out in the saints in their grasp of the truth, the truth of the Person of Christ, for instance. The oil had to be beaten. Moses¬ instructions were to bring pure, beaten olive oil for the light; @Leviticus 24: 5. The testimony may not shine much in some of our localities perhaps, because of the lack of this feature of beating in us. It refers to our bringing what has passed through deep exercise. And the incense -- some of it was beaten and put before the testimony in the tabernacle. The more it was beaten the more the fragrance would come out. Perhaps these things may be applied, dear brethren, to Paul and Silas, and others, who in a way are suffering at the present time. There is more to be got out of them in such adversity than there is in the time of prosperity. Scripture speaks of the time of adversity (@Ecclesiastes 7: 14), there is wealth and gain from that. Job speaks of the *cold* from the north, and *gold* from the north. There is some affinity, it would seem.
These things I would desire to leave with us, practical impressions for our minds in regard of Christ, and our prayers, and impressions in regard of the Spirit. We might perhaps value the Spirit more than we have done. He is the best Friend we have on earth, as we have been constantly reminded. As one servant of the Lord said, 'How are you treating such a Guest?' All these thoughts arise in our minds, so that if there comes any occasion for actual literal suffering it may be to our gain, and prayer turned into praise. May the Lord just help us in these impressions for His name's sake.
{316}
THE SPIRIT
R. H. Selwood
@Galatians 6: 7, 8; @2 Timothy 2: 7
Just a thought, beloved, that has come to me while we have been together, particularly from the meeting we had this morning, where the great thought of *the* Spirit was brought before us. One has noticed that in this epistle to the Galatians every time the Spirit is alluded to, with the exception of one, He is spoken of as "*the* Spirit". What came to one's mind in this is the importance of what we are sowing to, whether we are sowing to the flesh, or sowing to the Spirit, because whatever we are sowing to the crop that we shall have will be on that line. The great point here is, "he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life". What results there will be from the Spirit Himself as the result of sowing to the Spirit! One would desire that we might all be marked by this feature more and more, dear brethren, of sowing to the Spirit, so that "*from the Spirit*" we "shall reap eternal life". God's great thought is that we should all be in the present enjoyment of eternal life, in a living system of things that we have had before us today, and the great point here is, that if we are to be in the enjoyment of that, we must heed the importance of sowing to the Spirit, and then it says, "*from the Spirit* shall reap eternal life". What a place the Spirit has in the great economy of God!
I just read the verse in Timothy because it says there, "Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". We have had "all things" before us today, and it says here, "the Lord will give thee understanding in all things". In this epistle everything that is for the pleasure and glory of God is all spoken of as being "in Christ
{317}
Jesus"; that is in Him where He is, in a position that the enemy can never attack. But then, on the other hand, Paul, in writing to Timothy, has much to say about *the Lord*, and the Lord is, at the present moment, the great Administrator of all that is established in Christ Jesus. And He is not only the Administrator of it, but He is the One who is the Deliverer and Supporter of those who are here in the testimony. Hence the great importance of recognising Paul's word -- "think of what I say". For us today, we are to think over what we get in the ministry, for instance in these meetings; we are to think over it, and the Lord will give us understanding in relation to it. The great thing is to think over these things in the presence of the Lord, in the sense of His presence supporting us, and He will give us the understanding in all things. Then as the epistle proceeds, Paul has much to say about the Lord. He says, "The Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of the Lord withdraw from iniquity", chapter 2: 19. Then in the next chapter we have the sufferings spoken of. Paul's sufferings that he was going through, but what is he able to say in regard to them, dear brethren? He says that out of them all "*the Lord* delivered me" (verse 11). What a sense he had of the presence and delivering power of the Lord in the sufferings through which he was passing in the testimonial position here, and what a word that was to Timothy. Think of the young brethren here, what a word this is for you, dear brethren, to think of Paul, just about to finish his course and passing on such a word as this to Timothy; he says, "and *the Lord* delivered me out of all". It was in the experience of his soul that he speaks of this, dear brethren. It is not simply a matter of doctrine, but it is an experience of his soul; he was conscious of the Lord's delivering power as he was moving here in
{318}
the pathway of testimony. Then in chapter 4 he says more, he says, "But the Lord stood with me, and gave me power" (verse 17), that is, he got the conscious sense of the support in power of the Lord as he moved in the testimonial position here, and one's desire in touching these scriptures is that we might all have a deeper sense in our souls of the power of the Spirit, and of the power of the Lord, for His name's sake.
{319}
THE SPIRIT'S IMPORTANCE TO THE BELIEVER
S. McCallum
@Numbers 21: 16 - 18; @Esther 2: 5 - 11; @Genesis 24: 1 - 9
There would be with every one of us, I am sure, an increasing sense of the need of the Spirit -- I speak to those who have the Spirit -- and I have in mind to speak tonight of the importance of the Spirit from the divine viewpoint -- I mean the importance from the divine viewpoint -- having in mind that we might be affected by it, especially the younger brethren, to see what, according to the type, divine Persons think and have in mind in relation to the presence of the Spirit with us and in us.
So I have repaired to the types, which the minister always can do, because of the advantage they afford in elucidating the truth. You feel for those who do not see the value of the sacred letters as we have them in the Old Testament, written for our learning as they have been, for they are lit up with divine glory all the way through. The Lord Jesus, in the book of the Acts, in the first chapter, shows the importance of the Spirit from the divine standpoint as He was to come in and characterise the dispensation in the way in which He does, the day of the Spirit. So that it is said of the Lord Jesus that He *charged* the apostles by the Holy Spirit that they should tarry at Jerusalem in relation to the coming of the Spirit.
In these passages that I have selected we have reference to the great resource that we have in the Spirit as a result of the word of the lawgiver, and then we have got in Esther the great care of the Spirit, the protective care and interest of the Spirit in type in the reference to the custody of Hegai, and
{320}
then latterly we have got the prime importance of the matter we have in hand in relation to the Spirit in @Genesis 24 in the oath of Abraham, "my oath", as he speaks of it.
The brethren will immediately see the prime importance of this great matter of the Spirit, for the lawgiver typifies Christ, Abraham typifies the Father, God in His parental interest in the wonderful relation of Father, and Hegai brings on to our view the great personal interest of the Spirit Himself in the care and protection of what is to be for God and for Christ and for the testimony in a scene where the enemy's power is known and felt. I am sure that if we consider these thoughts carefully we shall see the necessity of knowing the Spirit better and for making greater room for Him, of entering into the blessedness more of communion with Him. It is important that our acquaintance with the Spirit should grow. You will remember how the Lord Jesus brought in the word in the way of solace and comfort to hearts that were disconcerted as they contemplated being bereft of His presence, He said He would send another Comforter. He referred to Him as One whom the world neither knows nor sees, but "ye know him, for he abides with you, and shall be in you", @John 14: 17. The Spirit is thus a Person to be known and to be acquainted with as taking the place of Christ here in the assembly at the present moment, Christ having died out of this world and gone into heaven at the right hand of God.
We have been engaged with the glory of Christ and it would be obvious to the most of us that if we are to become greater lovers of Christ and to grow and develop in our apprehension and appreciation of Him we must necessarily make greater room for the Spirit. It is a wonderful thing to take account of Him, so near to us, indeed He is with us in a way that no other one could be in this world, having first-hand
{321}
knowledge of our minds and hearts and all that is within us, our bodies being His temple, His shrine. What great thoughts these are, dear brethren! With what dignity we should take account of ourselves as thus indwelt by the Spirit, as @James 4: 5 refers to Him as taking up His abode within us. Think of that, a divine Person, co-equal with the Father and the Son, taking up His abode in believers, in persons like you and me, young and old. What a sober and yet what a glorious matter that is, and therefore we need to be conscious of His presence, we need to know the blessedness of being on easy terms with Him, of having Him with us and in us in an ungrieved manner and way. How many things we allow perhaps unjudged that grieve Him in His sensitiveness, but which He would help us to take account of and to judge and to set aside in our hearts, that we might have Him in an ungrieved way. He becomes a Friend, as we often allude to Him, without compare in the path that we are treading at the moment through the wilderness with a view to meeting Christ. He is a real Person, young brother and sister, to be known and to be loved and to be communed with, and the measure of our development spiritually and our growth in relation to Christ, the measure of our spirituality, flows out of the measure in which we make room for Him at every turn of our path. He knows all about us, He knows our make-up, He knows our tendencies and our proclivities, but He is with us and in us to work out as He can, the great divine Agent for all subjective operations in this present dispensation. He can work out despite the adverse circumstances in you and me, our pride naturally, our independence, our wilfulness, it may be. He can work out as way and room is made and left for Him, the great wonderful operations that in their consummation will have us completely conformed to Christ in glory.
{322}
So I began with @Numbers 21, where, as a result of the administration of Christ, the Spirit is brought on to our view typically in the well, as a great resource for the believer in the path that in life leads right into the inheritance, into the choiceness of that realm where all is of God in Christ and which God has marked out for those that are the subjects of the counsels of His love before the world was. What a resource the Spirit is in the well, as typified in its springing up as is contemplated, over against the dark background of Numbers. The Spirit is viewed in @Numbers 21 in the light of the antitype in @Romans 8, as the great resource of the believer, as becoming all to the believer until he reaches Christ in relation to Colossians where Christ is everything and in all. But it is a wonderful thing to take account of this fact in the light of @Romans 8 and @Numbers 21 in the type, that the Spirit is to be everything to us until we reach that point -- not that He leaves us there, for we shall always need the Spirit, not only now but through all eternity we shall know the blessedness of His indwelling as no other family will in the same manner and degree. Numbers has in mind this great resource coming to light over against the dark background of the eruptions of the flesh. The book of Numbers opens to our view the vastness of divine resource, that in a world that is arid and devoid of resource for the believer. God can furnish that which is adequate to carry him through and maintain him in the most adversative circumstances. But despite the manifestation of divine provision we have to learn, as it is important we should learn, the incorrigible nature and character of the flesh. It is a bitter lesson but it is a necessary lesson and an important lesson to learn. Over against divine interventions, over against the shining of the glory definitely marking out where God is in His sovereign dispositions, in His sovereign selections, we have in
{323}
the midst of it all how the flesh in its incorrigible nature erupts to challenge and question the rights of the God, who in the wealth and abundance of the grace that wrought in our deliverance from Egypt and the power of Pharaoh, has brought us to Himself. What a God we find in the desert, in the wilderness, over against the flesh and its breaking out, and the marvellous thing in Numbers is that it breaks out and erupts in great and small, in brothers and sisters, in princes, yes -- and I speak soberly and guardedly -- in the great man Moses. We are reminded thus that we can look for nothing from the flesh, we have to come to it in our souls experimentally that the flesh is enmity against God. You cannot change it, you cannot improve it, it is incorrigible, unchangeable. Yet in the midst of all that in this book you get the bright rays of Nazarite devotion, of princely dedication and wealth attached thereto, augmenting the great system in which God is known as in the antitype in the assembly, and in the great thoughts that come out later in the book in the bread of God's offering and the like. God reminding us, dear brethren, that we must go on despite the adversative circumstances, showing us what God can do despite the circumstances, despite the incorrigibility of the flesh. But we have to come to it in the light of deliverance in Romans that we are not only delivered from the world as in @Romans 6, viewed as a sin system out of which Christ has died, we are not only delivered from the law as referred to in @Romans 7, but we are to know the blessedness of deliverance from that incorrigible state that is linked with the flesh, so that the believer, according to the truth of the glad tidings, as he reaches deliverance in @Romans 8, is able to take account of himself as no longer in the flesh but in the Spirit, as God's Spirit dwells in him or her. How wonderful that is, and @Numbers 21 has in mind that, prefaced by the great thought of
{324}
the brazen serpent, God's judicial dealing with the flesh, the only thing He could do with it was to condemn it. It is difficult to come to, for we hang on to it and we do not dissociate ourselves from it as we should, and bitterness and murmuring and complaining all result in disaster. We murmur with God's choice, where He has put us and where He has placed us; we murmur about the provisions He has made in such wonderful grace, we may quarrel with His sovereignty in relation to a Moses and an Aaron, as is evidenced in the great band of Korah, and we are found in these circumstances not any different from Israel, we may say, for these experiences are very real, and we are to learn from them the incorrigible nature of the flesh. We know not where the flesh may erupt next if room is made for it, if way is allowed for it, but God wants to fasten our attention on the lawgiver and as I might speak of Him, the Lord Jesus Christ wants to fasten our attention on this great matter of the well, that we are to see the advantage of having the Spirit, that the Spirit is going to be everything to us, that what the flesh was in us as the source and seat of murmuring, complaining and discontent and finding fault with God and with His provisions, the Spirit is to become to us as the Source and seat of all that is pleasing to God and all that is helpful morally and spiritually to ourselves.
So in the brazen serpent, we need to learn, as feeling the bite, what sin is in the flesh, from this viewpoint. We need to feel it and to look, and get a view of the cross, get a view of the Son of Man lifted up, and see God's judicial dealing with this state out of which came murmuring, rebellion and discontent. God would show us how He has met it. Oh! the sufferings of Christ, dear brethren, do they not touch our souls? These difficulties that break out in our localities, these discontented conditions, and murmurings and rebellion, they come up from time to time. What do
{325}
they spring from? They spring from that state that God could only deal judicially with, and He dealt with it in His Son. Think of it! Think of what it meant to God! We are to be affected by that. The result is that at the word of the lawgiver the well is digged, as if through the wonderful administration of Christ in the supreme place of authority as bringing to bear upon us the supremacy of the will of God -- in that very place where that is known and enjoyed in our souls there is to be this wonderful provision, as it says, "Israel sang this song, Rise up, well! sing unto it: Well which princes digged, which the nobles of the people hollowed out at the word of the lawgiver, with their staves". That is, the Spirit now comes on to our view in type in the well and in actuality in @Romans 8, as the great Resource that is to lead us forward in this pathway that lies ahead, leading across the Jordan, right into the inheritance, for it is not in mind that we should stay in Romans and the scene which Romans contemplates. It is in mind that we should go on to the great thoughts of God, to what He has for us in relation to Christ and the assembly, and the wonderful thoughts according to what was in the divine mind before the world was. He wants us to move into them and the Spirit is given, and from this point onwards -- I am going over old ground but the younger ones need to be reminded of it -- from here on there is no mention of the tabernacle, and the cloud is not referred to as it has been referred to before. So that as we have in @Romans 8 we get the leadership of the Spirit. The believer now has a great Leader by which he is led subjectively in this path of life, in which he is to know no death. What a path it is! For the first time they acquired territory, as you will notice later in this chapter. Israel took all these cities. Immediately the Spirit comes on to our view in this way, in this light, in type in the well, and in the antitype in
{326}
@Romans 8, we have territory acquired, not permanent territory, as we have had pointed out, but provisional territory, in which we are to live for the moment in view of passing over. So that Israel took cities. They had never taken them before, but it shows the great resourcefulness that is linked with the presence of the Spirit and His leadings in this relation. So it says in @Romans 8, "as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father" (verse 14, 15). Think of that territory, dear brethren, as soon as the leading of the Spirit is referred to we get that choice bit of territory referred to on the wilderness side of the Jordan, yet in actuality belonging to the other side of the Jordan, so that the believer moves into it, the known and blessed relation of God as Father, "Abba, Father". Think of the benefit and gain of the Spirit thus known. Instead of waiting to come to the meeting to get a little spurt and a start -- thank God we do -- we come to know a sure resource of sustained help and support all the way through. The tabernacle led before, and the cloud, the divine presence, as we have had it in these meetings, leading, but then we go back to our localities and are we going to get down, are we going to get under circumstances, under the weather, in our localities, or are we to go back in the conscious gain and knowledge of the Spirit's leading, His great subjective power and resource by which we are sustained in freshness, in strength and power to complete the wilderness way?
Now I come to Esther and I want to refer to this expression, "the custody of Hegai". It is a beautiful touch, dear brethren, it is one of those gems that are hidden in the many settings that we have in the Old Testament. Custody, as you know, brings up the thought of care and protection. I would say,
{327}
dear brethren, we are only safe from this viewpoint as in the hands of the Spirit. We are sure to come to disaster if we get out of the hand of the Spirit. We never read of Vashti being in the custody of Hegai, and the result was that Vashti came to disaster, as we all will come to disaster. The great preservative from the exercise of our own wills and our own minds in the holy realm of God's supremacy as is contemplated indirectly in this book, in the great kingdom that is displayed in the wealth of it, the only safety is in being in the hands of the Spirit. What will the Spirit not do? What did not Hegai do for Esther? She pleased him and he gave her the best and he gave her everything she required, and I might also perhaps suggest, more than she required. And oh, what the believer becomes to divine Persons, whether we view the spirit of Christ in Mordecai operating in the advancing of Esther into the wonderful favour into which she is advanced as in association with the king, or whether it be the custody of Hegai. We need to know the custody of Hegai in a world where so much is made of human strength and human resource and human ability, we need to know what it is to be under the hand of Mordecai, typifying the spirit of Christ among the brethren that would put us into the position of most advantage, the custody of the Spirit. Young brothers and sisters, what a thing it is to get into the custody of Hegai, what possibilities, what advantages! Think of how Esther advanced! The marital relation comes on to our view in this book, she is advanced to the position of the queen, royalty. Think of the regality thus linked with the position, think of what the Lord would do for us, think of what the Spirit would do for us, as we come under His protective interest and care, watching over us with these various spices given, so that we should grow and develop in the spirit of Christ, which would be in mind. Think of the unselfishness of Mordecai.
{328}
I would challenge our localities, dear brethren, as to whether the spirit of Mordecai is in them. We may speak about the young people and how they act and where they go, the tendency to drift into the world, but where is the spirit of Mordecai in our localities that will take on the Esthers and hand them over to the custody of Hegai? You may want to put them to the universities, you may want to put them in the best position they can get in the world, and they may be perhaps permanently crippled and damaged for the assembly. They have to be educated, and they have to learn so as to make their way, especially in these days when we have to know what it is to be kept clear and free of unholy associations, but let the prime thought in our minds be in regard to our children and our young people how they will advance in *spiritual* greatness. What does it matter if they reach a place of advantage and power in the world if they are permanently crippled for the assembly, spoiled for God and for Christ by the god of this world? Surely not, dear brethren! We would have the best thoughts in mind for our children and for our young people. Think of Jacob as we were alluding to it the other day, when he comes to Dan in @Genesis 49 -- he goes over the features of the different members, he is not sparing, he does not issue plaudits or say wonderful things about them that are not true, he faithfully goes over the ground, pointing out how their tendencies and their propensities to evil and their addiction in certain relations to evil, he faithfully faces it in his house, and when he comes down to Dan, what does he do? His heart turns to God, as if when he comes to Dan he virtually says, Well, my only hope, my only resource is God, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah", @Genesis 49: 18. Think of the priestly turning of that heart to God! Jacob, who had spent the best years of his life making money and getting every advantage there in Padan-Aram,
{329}
but now recovered and looking out upon the great potentialities for the testimony, the great thought of God's number, the twelve, when he comes to Dan he does not know what way things will turn out with Dan, but he says, "I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah". We need to have that spirit, dear brethren, priestly power with God in relation to the preservation of what is necessary to carry on the testimony and complete God's number.
So that Esther is committed to the custody of Hegai, it says, "keeper of the women", and it says, "the maiden pleased him". I wonder, dear brother and sister, if we please the Spirit. We speak of pleasing God and pleasing Christ, but do we please the Spirit? When we go down into the world and have to do with things in it, young brother, young sister, when we go to the store, to the shop, do we allow our eyes to drift on to things that defile us, that impart impressions to us that incite the passions and impulses of the flesh. That would not be pleasing to the Spirit of God, pleasing to Hegai. Oh, the advantage of being in the custody of the Spirit, in the care and protection of the Spirit! He will be everything to us that we need until we completely get out of the wilderness where Christ is everything and in all. It says, "he removed her and her maids to the best place". Young people, you want to get on, we all want to get on, I want to get on and you want to get on. What is the best way? is the common question asked. To get on spiritually, I say humbly and soberly, let yourself be given into the hands of the Spirit, let yourself be given into the custody of Hegai, who will do the best for you in concert with Mordecai. Mordecai is watching over the whole matter. The spirit of Christ among the people of God is watching over this matter, and the holy consort is very interesting between Mordecai and Hegai. It says, "Mordecai walked every day before
{330}
the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her". What about that in our localities, dear brethren? Are we day by day watching over the nurturing and care and development of this great feature of the work of God, as I may refer to it, in Esther, that is to come into the testimony at the crucial moment and work out for the salvation of the people of God over against the terrible spirit of the rival to Christ, Haman, who is always with us as long as we are here, seeking to, as it were, set down all that is of God and of Christ? What need there is for the spirit of Mordecai, so that we as believers should be kept in relation to Hegai and the custody of Hegai.
Now just a finishing word, dear brethren, as to the oath of Abraham. We see in this chapter in the type the whole Godhead, all the Trinity, are engaged with the prime importance of the Spirit as it bears upon believers, as it bears upon the assembly. So it is very affecting to one that this oath should enter as it does into @Genesis 24 in relation to the matter of the servant going forth to secure Rebecca for Isaac. It is no ordinary matter, dear brethren, that the Spirit has come from on high, sent from heaven. Divine faithfulness enters into it, divine pledge enters into it. The oath is to bring out in the parental setting here divine committal to the whole matter, and it involves in the working out of the chapter that we should be ready to yield the Spirit what is justly His due, to make full room for Him as He would take us out of things here, detach us from all that is material and all that is natural in its influence upon us but hindering, to conduct us to Christ so as to be the joy of the heart of Christ in the testimonial setting which is viewed in type in the end of the chapter. Think of this matter, as it says in verse 6, "Beware that thou bring not my son thither again. Jehovah the God of the heavens, who took me out
{331}
of my father's house, and out of the land of my nativity, and who has sworn to me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land -- he will send his angel before thee, that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence. And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be quit of this my oath: only, bring not my son thither again". You see, it is the emphasis on the heavenly position, that we cannot bring Christ into things here. If we are going to reach Christ in the light of Isaac we must reach Him in His own realm officially as He is the heavenly Man, and be united to Him there. Are we prepared to go? You have a good business, a nice family, you do not want to leave, they are your life; it may be, all your attention focussed on them. Think of the divine oath lying behind this great matter, that the Spirit should come into this wonderful position in the type, to lead us out of all these things into the blessed attachment to Christ, indeed union with Christ, that the end of the chapter contemplates.
May God help us to see the value of the Spirit and to make greater room for Him and to know the joy of communion with Him all through the desert path until we reach Christ and see Him face to face in glory, for His name's sake.
{332}
SPIRITUAL INWARDNESS (1)
@2 Samuel 12: 24 (latter half, "and she bore ..." ) -- 25; @1 Kings 1: 38, 39; @1 Chronicles 29: 22 - 25
S.McC. It is thought that we might get help in regard to spiritual inwardness, and with this in mind it is proposed to look at two distinct types of Christ that appear in these books that we have read from. They are types that refer to how Christ is apprehended in a hidden way, in relation to the purpose and counsel of God, and as apprehended in this hidden way, the saints are built up inwardly in relation to what is fixed and eternal. It is proposed to consider, this morning, Solomon personally, as in the passages that we have read; and then this afternoon, the other type in the ark, as it appears in these particular sections that we shall read from. It is important that we see the mystery linked with these two types; the mystery of God is bound up in these two types, over against the changing scenes linked with infidelity in the scenes of the testimony as they are passed before us in these books; both lines of the truth in regard to the Person of Christ converging on the service of God. You remember that it is said of David, when he took Zion, that he "built round about from the Millo and inward" (@2 Samuel 5: 9); a rather mysterious reference as it is, the Millo itself, with the definite article before it. The way it is referred to conveys the thought of what is hidden, and involving mystery to faith, and to those that have the Spirit. I think the building inward is linked with the lines of the truth in regard to Christ apprehended in a hidden way, which we are about to consider. I thought we would begin with Solomon, Jedidiah, here. As the brethren perhaps would know, there are two references to Solomon in the second book of Samuel,
{333}
this is the second, and this one is more concrete than the other. We get no more reference to Solomon in the second book of Samuel directly, and this passage stands out like a gem in the book here, for faith, and for those that have the Spirit, because even while it may be a type, no one could question the fact that Christ must be very specially in mind in what is said in the last part of verse 24, that we read, "and Jehovah loved him". Over against the background of failure and breakdown in David, God is indicating where His affections lie; and what we will see, as we take an extended view of the matter is that *we* are challenged as to where *our* affections lie. We find that in the course of things in this book, the sorrow of misplaced affection is very tragic; and we have to learn that, every one of us, involving it may be sorrow with us, but God is giving us a definite indication of where His affections lie, and we want to be in line with God -- "Jehovah loved him". The preciousness of Jesus immediately comes on to our view, Jesus as seen in the gospels, the secret hidden side that God commits Himself to, the Man that God has before Him, and He has in mind. And we shall never be built up inwardly apart from that side of the truth. If we do not catch hold, or are detained in relation to this side of the truth, we shall centre our thoughts and our affections on the wrong man, on the man of sin and shame, on the man seen in Ammon, in Absalom, and in Joab. It is a very real matter that we should learn how to turn, in our own hearts, from the features of the man of sin and shame, to the Man of God's purpose and counsel, as to whom it points here in saying, "and Jehovah loved him". It is the babe; it is what is within small compass; it may be thought little of by the world, unknown indeed as to its importance by the world, and by unbelief, and by fleshly mind and activity; but known and apprehended by faith in those that have the Spirit.
{334}
I thought that we might get some help in considering the truth as to these types of Christ on the hidden side in the second book of Samuel.
G.H.S.P. You have something special in mind in that the love of Jehovah is expressed at the birth of Solomon, before there was even anything that might draw out that love.
S.McC. Exactly, that is, we have no suggestion in the passage of any action or movement in Solomon himself; there is something there that draws out the affections of God, just like when Jesus appeared on the scene in this world, there was that which drew out divine affections.
G.H.S.P. Does Simeon come in early in Luke as a man evidently having close links with the Spirit, and thus ready to embrace the child Jesus as a Babe, as God's Christ?
S.McC. He was in accord with the movements above, the movements in heaven in regard to this great intervention on the part of God; he is not behind, he comes in at the right moment as under the influence of the Spirit. So that his affections are not misplaced, they are rightly placed, where *God's* affections are placed, in that wonderful Babe.
A.H. Are you thinking that this appreciation of Christ is arrived at experimentally? I was thinking of verse 20 of this chapter, and then the way that David names this child. Does God sending by Nathan confirm David in his exercises?
S.McC. I think so. We are to see the importance of the prophetic ministry in that relation, and how God makes much of Nathan's service in the book of Samuel. If we are not regulated by the prophetic ministry, our affections will be misplaced, and instead of seeing that Christ, typified in Solomon, is the great Object and Centre of divine affection, and that He is to be the centre of our affection too, we may move on antichristian principles, and make room for what is
{335}
disruptive and dislocating in the sphere of testimony.
E.J.H. Do you see that in Isaac and Rebecca? At the very birth of Jacob it is said that Rebecca loved Jacob, and Isaac loved Esau; at the end of the Old Testament Jehovah confirms that He had loved Jacob at birth too? Were Isaac's affections misplaced and Rebecca's rightly placed?
S.McC. Do you think that that love in Malachi refers to Jacob at birth?
E.J.H. I thought that he was the man of God's choice and purpose.
S.McC. I do not think it is quite the same as we have here. I think this is unique here. What we have in Jehovah loving Solomon is unique and alone in the Old Testament. There is nothing before it, and nothing comes after it in the Old Testament that equals what we have here. I think when it says that God loved Jacob, it involves what is characteristically seen in Jacob; whereas, in what we have here, it is a question of something intrinsic, it says "Jehovah loved him". There would be a link as it develops, in the sense that Jacob is in line with the counsel of God, and Rebecca is in sympathy with that.
E.J.H. I was thinking partly of the misplaced affections in Isaac.
S.McC. Just so.
A.E.M. In Solomon you have the Man of God's purpose, and His love can be proclaimed at the beginning.
S.McC. That is remarkable; it is not after Solomon has got to the throne, and is established in the kingdom; it is when Solomon is born that Jehovah intervenes by the prophetic ministry to call his name Jedidiah for Jehovah's sake, and it says "Jehovah loved him". It is a marvellous statement, and must have Christ in mind in anticipation.
A.E.M. It is not for David's sake, but for Jehovah's sake.
{336}
S.McC. That is it. So it is a wonderful thing to be drawn into that, to be drawn into the current of what is for Jehovah's sake. The dark background in this section would fill the mind with dismay and disconsolateness, if we were to be occupied with it; but God interjects into that dark background this holy scene where He finds an object for His affections to be placed upon.
P.H.H. The prophetic ministry you spoke of had come in previously, had it not, in Nathan, in regard of the building of the house in chapter 7? Did that serve to put into David's mind the thought of the son, although just initially?
S.McC. I think so. That is the first reference, is it not?
P.H.H. I wondered if you would just say something about that, to enlarge your earlier statement.
S.McC. Well. Nathan peculiarly stands in relation to Solomon, as you would know. It is not Gad; Gad does not stand in relation to Solomon. Just as Abigail is brought on to our view following Samuel's ministry, so Solomon is brought on to our view as linked with Nathan's ministry. And it is important to see that. The first indication is given in that chapter that you referred to, where David has a desire to build the house, but God indicates to him through Nathan the prophet that *he* is not to be the one that would build the house, but the son that will be born to him.
P.H.H. Even there would you say, God was projecting, as it were, His affections, "I will be his father, and he shall be my son", @2 Samuel 7: 14?
S.McC. He was indicating it, not just so definitely as it is here in "Jehovah loved him", but the thought of it is there, in the relationship that God refers to. There it is in prospect, here it is in actuality, "Jehovah loved him". A marvellous thing to take account of.
G.H.S.P. Would you bring any passage in the
{337}
New Testament, in the gospels, directly alongside of this?
S.McC. Well, I would, the entrance of Christ into manhood, the condition of humanity, draws out heaven's feelings.
G.H.S.P. I wondered whether the Father's voice at the baptism "In thee I have found my delight" would throw certain light on the whole of that period of thirty years.
S.McC. Well, it does. It reflects back on what came in in Jesus, and as He grew up into manhood; it reflects back on all that undisclosed period where there must have been so much that was so rich and so precious to God.
W.E.W. Does Nathan's prophetic ministry, "thou art the man" help us to see that it is in the displacement of the old man that we can ever enter into the appreciation of this secret name, that is Jedidiah?
S.McC. That is the intent of the setting of Solomon here, because it is just brought in here and left; there is nothing developed, in later chapters, in regard to Solomon. It is just left, as if God, in the midst of the disaster and the sorrow and the grief in the background, would give us a focal point on which He is resting, and on which we are to rest, in the displacement of all that is so obnoxious in our hearts. It is thus that we are built up inwardly in the truth.
P.L. So that it is as facing governmental conditions so sorrowful, that the soul is anchored in that secret name of undisclosed delight?
S.McC. It is important to see what is fixed in that way; we shall see it more especially in relation to the ark as the centre of the whole testimony, and the centre of the scope of the truth. You have got there a fixed system of things that revolves around the testimonial Christ, that we are not to depart from, and we are not to give up the ground in relation to. But here there is an indication by God through
{338}
prophetic ministry, of what *His* affections are fixed on.
P.L. So that the thought of life and incorruptibility brought to light in this glorious Person in @2 Timothy 1 furnishes the background and spiritual anchorage to face all the sorrows pertaining to the breakdown, in the assembly, as forecasted in these chapters that follow?
S.McC. Yes. So that it is important that we should repair into this, because it becomes very practical. After this definite indication by God to David as to Solomon and Jedidiah, why the sorrowful chapters of history that follow? Why the great cry in regard to Absalom, "O my son, Absalom, my son", where God was indicating that *Solomon* was his son, *Solomon* was the object upon which his affections were to be centred? This is very practical to us, for why is it, in the presence of all the prophetic ministry we have had, all the wealth and the power of it, and affected as we have been under it, we drift into a confused state of things where our affections may become misdirected and misplaced? The natural side, as it were, arises and confusion is the result. It is very real.
E.C.L. Would what you are saying connect with the name of Jesus? It is Christ personally I am thinking of how He spoke to Paul, "I am Jesus", and also of His last words recorded in Revelation "I, Jesus".
S.McC. It no doubt would. It is the personal side -- "Jehovah loved him". It would be the personal side in Jesus, only it is the *babe*; it is what is there in small compass, and in what we might call a hidden and mysterious way. That Jehovah should love that babe, over against the dark picture around, surely points us to the gospels, and to the Object of God's affections placed on Christ there.
A.E.M. Would you not say what was in that Babe is to fill eternity?
{339}
S.McC. That is the point. So how broad Simeon's outlook becomes, and extended his view, as that Babe is in his arms. What it must have been to have held that Babe in his arms, as he says, "a light for revelation of the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel". His view becomes greatly extended in the light of the Babe.
C.M.M. In @Proverbs 4: 3, Solomon says, "For I was a son unto my father", would that show the way this thought developed in all the days of difficulty? Do we see sonship developed in Solomon?
S.McC. That is it. Proverbs gives us the developed side, from *Solomon's* side, "*I* was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother". But Solomon is just here as a babe, no characteristics or personality are as yet developed. The personality is there, of course, because Jehovah called him Jedidiah, but there it is, "and Jehovah loved him". It is as if God would give us some indication, in a hidden secret way, through the prophetic service, as to where His mind and His affections lie, so that we might be saved from the disaster that David lands in.
A.H. Does @Isaiah 9: 6 at all bear on it, "unto us a child is born"? Does the prophet come to it, and through his ministry bring the saints to it?
S.McC. That would be what they arrive at from their side, the remnant say "unto us", it would be the parallel side in the soul of the remnant. Here it is not what the child is to the remnant, it is what the babe is to Jehovah; it says "Jehovah loved him. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake", meaning "Beloved of Jehovah". Now Jedidiah is never mentioned again, that is a remarkable thing.
P.H.H. Does this mean that as we receive this thought it becomes a kind of potential which underlies everything else that may happen, and as time
{340}
goes on, and prophetic ministry comes, it is capable of stabilising us in relation to God's thoughts all the way through?
S.McC. That is how I understand it, and that is how one is looking at it, because if we do not get into the apprehension and appreciation of Christ in this hidden inward way, we shall become built up in *ourselves* in the features of the man of sin and shame. So that when the crises arise in the testimony, we miss our way; our affections become misplaced, natural feelings come uppermost, as in David, and in Joab and the others.
A.C.S.P. Does the fact of the naming suggest how God absolutely commits Himself to this position?
S.McC. I think that is the point, "And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and *he* called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake". It is not just that Jehovah loved him, precious as that is; but Jehovah is committed to this, in the sending. The sending brings in the idea of the commission, and the committal to Solomon.
A.C.S.P. Might that be why the name does not come up again? The committal is absolute, and now lies hidden behind everything else.
S.McC. Yes. It helps us to see that there is what is rare and special and choice in God's realm, there are names that we do not use promiscuously. The name of "Abba Father" for instance; that is so choice, and so rare, as we might say, as special to our dispensation. How sparse is its use in the New Testament; but what preciousness is linked with it!
G.H.M. Would you connect the bosom of the Father with what you are saying?
S.McC. Well, that enters into it, as the thought develops; the Lord came into that position where He was the Object of the Father's affections.
A.E.B. Would the way that the New Testament begins bear on this, "Book of the generation of
{341}
Jesus Christ, Son of David"? Is not the Son of David Solomon? Might there not be a hidden reference there to the One who was in the mind of God from the very beginning?
S.McC. I think the New Testament is filled with references in that way, to the line of David, to Christ coming in on that line. There is what is general, on the line of David; but there is what is choice and rare and exclusive, and this particular section is calling our attention to it.
P.L. Is it the divine ideal enshrined in the heart -- "the hidden man of the heart"; and then in "the incorruptible ornament of a meek and quiet spirit", is the ideal to be brought forth, which "in the sight of God is of great price" (@1 Peter 3: 4)?
S.McC. I think that is how it is to work out. Therefore it is very important that we should see how God is calling attention to this, in calling his name through the prophet Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake. God would bring us into the secret of Christ in this way, so that everything in our lives is to revolve around this. Because we have to look into history with ourselves, we have to see what we have been catering to, and what we have been ministering to in ourselves. We have to see whether we have got this focal point that God, as it were, puts on to our view here; and whether we are following this through. If we follow it through, then we shall be in line with God at the end.
G.H.S.P. So that the gift of the prophets in @Ephesians 4 is directly linked with the saints arriving "at the full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of the Christ".
S.McC. Just so. And it is on this line that we are built up, the building inward is on this line, because what the enemy is seeking to produce is a rival to Christ. This whole book, especially in the body of it, is filled with the operation of antichristian influence,
{342}
to divert the saints from Christ, to misplace affections under the most specious form of operation, so that Christ, the Man of God's counsels, is displaced.
E.J.H. Do you see that in the shepherds? They found the Babe, and they spoke only of what had been told them about the Babe. Do you see in those persons those who are wholly committed to the Babe, and have no other conversation but concerning Him?
S.McC. Just so, they are affected by what has come in in that way. The reputation of the shepherds would not be great in the religious world, or in Caesar's world; they would be of little account, but they come into the light of God's appointed choice in the Babe.
J.J.T. Would the unborn babe leaping in the womb suggest the inwardness on the part of Elizabeth, Mary coming in with her message?
S.McC. Well, we see how there is the thought of what is within, linking with the great thought of the body; the body is a wonderful organism, where there are impressions of Christ that are awakened in our contacts with one another. In that sense it would suggest what is inward.
A.L.R.T. It says of Mary in @Luke 2: 19, that she "kept all these things in her mind, pondering them in her heart". Would that indicate the way in which we may be led into this inwardness?
S.McC. I think so; that is that we must be prepared to listen. Mary listened to Jesus¬ word, sitting at His feet, and the ministry of Nathan involves that we have got to have an ear, we have got to listen. Where was David's ear, you see, in the chapters that follow? Ammon comes up, and all the sorrow of misplaced and misdirected affections in the next chapter, and then Absalom comes up. One by one, the different persons come up; Joab, and the woman come up, directing attention to Absalom. When God was directing attention to
{343}
Christ in type in Solomon, we have the operation in the woman of the mystery of iniquity, working speciously to attract attention to Absalom.
R.G.B. Is the prophetic word from this point of view to bring us round to God's viewpoint? Is it when we come round to God's viewpoint that we are really saved from these other matters?
S.McC. I think that is the point, and the earlier we are affected by this the better. If we think of the younger ones coming on; it is not a question of what is current in the world, where they have great persons at sports and athletics, and in the field of learning, and in the field of politics, men that stand out and become an ideal, but Christ is to be our ideal, and the sooner we learn that He is God's Centre of affection the better. If our affections do not get centred on Christ they will be built around ourselves, and the man that God is displacing by Christ.
J.C.T. Are the three references to the Spirit in connection with Simeon significant? I was wondering whether only the Spirit would lead us into this appreciation of Christ. How needful it is that He should have way with us in order to do so!
S.McC. The Spirit *must* come into these matters, because the Spirit's help is constantly needed in regard to this matter of inwardness, and of our holding to the divine centre of affection. If we do not make use of the Spirit, our affections will get out of control, and will get misplaced; and there will be much sorrow and grief resultant.
P.L. In @2 Samuel 23 there is a wonderful delineation of Christ, "The anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet Psalmist of Israel", "the Rock of Israel" and so on, and the cloudless morning. Then the mighties at that point are brought in, and it says that David had them (verse 8); and then there is the smiting of two lion-like men of Moab by Benaiah; and the different exploits of the mighties. Do you think
{344}
that the energy to deal with all these rival heroic elements you refer to lies in the cherishing of this great ideal?
S.McC. I am sure it does, because the whole operation of the mystery of lawlessness is to enamour us with another ideal, a rival to Christ, with sonship on another line. If we might just refer to @2 Samuel 14 for a moment, and see the language of the mystery of iniquity in the end of verse 7 she says "so they will quench my coal which is left". Then in verse 11, "lest they cut off my son". Then in verse 16, "that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God". Well, we might say, that is very touching language, surely that would draw out sympathy and feeling! But who is the "coal", who is the "my son"? It is the man of sin in type, the antichrist; it is Absalom. You can see how the thing works speciously to misdirect feelings and sympathy into the wrong channel, and converge them on the wrong object, over against what God has been indicating in the ministry, as to Jedidiah, Solomon.
A.H. That brought in great loss of life, but the prophet in 1 Kings that you referred to says, "let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon", chapter 1: 12.
S.McC. I am sure that all this is very practical in its bearing upon every one of us, for God will not support or countenance in any of us the features of the man of sin and shame; but He will strengthen every bit of affection that there is for the Man of His counsel, the Man of His purpose. And we want to be in that.
-- .L. We might be built up in what is fixed and eternal. I was struck with your remark; is that where everything is fixed?
S.McC. It is a fixed matter you see. There is no going back on it on the part of God. But then there
{345}
is no going back on it on the part of the saints -- that is what we want to come to -- they anointed Solomon king a second time.
-- .L. There was nothing fixed about these other men, was there, they all met disaster? Everything is fixed in Solomon.
S.McC. Yes. To get to this point of anointing Solomon the second time; we are living in a day when there is so much said about persons going back on things, going back on the truth, going back on what they have formerly held, and on what they have formerly enjoyed. That is not God's way. In Chronicles, as Solomon becomes the focal object, they anoint him a second time. They do not go back on the truth, the matter is sustained all the way through in @1 Chronicles 29.
P.H.H. That is, they confirmed what God had already designated.
S.McC. That is it. And confirmed what *they* had already designated. When Solomon was anointed in @1 Kings 1: 39 "all the people said Long live king Solomon!" That is, there was the first time, and there was the second time. They did not go back on it, they confirmed what originally had been done.
P.H.H. Does that explain a little the rising of the priest in 1 Kings? Early there is a mention of these men, Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, and Nathan; but as the narrative goes on, it is Zadok the priest who comes to the forefront. Is there something in that?
S.McC. I think so, because you will notice that in the last passage Zadok is linked with Solomon in Chronicles, he is anointed to be priest, showing the exalted level on to which Zadok is brought. Nathan the prophet is the representative of God; Zadok is linked with Solomon in a peculiar way in that passage, so that we are to notice his prominence here, and we are to notice the prominence of David's mule, and
{346}
Gihon, and the horn of oil out of the tabernacle. In @2 Samuel 12 it is more the private view as we are brought into God's secret over against the disaster and the background. The assembly comes on to our view now in @1 Kings 1 in the tabernacle, and the horn of oil which is linked with it. And then the name Gihon means stream and in Gihon there was a fountain or reservoir of water. You remember how in the day of revival in Hezekiah's time when the enemy came in, Hezekiah stopped the waters of Gihon, and brought them down underground to the west side of the city of David; @2 Chronicles 32: 30. Gihon brings in the thought of the Spirit in a *general* way in the dispensation, the horn of oil is the Spirit in a *special* distinctive way, as out of the tabernacle, all entering into this matter now, of the anointing of Solomon.
P.H.H. Would you just say a little about the connection between what is priestly and what is prophetic? Do they serve one another as features amongst the saints?
S.McC. They do, but there is this difference, that the priest can go where the prophet cannot.
P.H.H. Yes; quite so. Would you say that the thought of the prophet comes out from God, and speaks on His behalf; but the priest can always go in, and is constitutionally a worshipper?
S.McC. That is it. So that Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle; he went in to the tent, and took the horn of oil out.
P.H.H. Does that mean that Zadok here, the priest, is so to speak in line with God's original thought about loving Solomon, calling him Jedidiah?
S.McC. I think it does, and it especially points to the way that the Spirit comes into the matter, over against the rival again, in Adonijah. The Spirit comes into the matter to consolidate the position through Zadok.
G.H.S.P. Might the assembly come in here as the
{347}
sphere in which the great thoughts of God are treasured inwardly?
S.McC. The whole secret is bound up with the assembly in that sense, that what is necessary to anoint Solomon is linked with the assembly; it is the Holy Spirit in relation to the assembly in this way, in view of Solomon standing out.
R.G.B. The Spirit of God will not tolerate any rival to Christ, and will He, as made room for, keep the hearts of the saints in that direction, and help us to preserve a condition of loyalty to Christ?
S.McC. I thought so, and the importance of Zadok the priest, showing the need for priestly influence in a background like this, where again we have got diverse elements that are operating; and really what is operating is that the hand is on the throne of Jah. In the last passage that we read, Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah; it is a mysterious reference, a remarkable and unique reference. He sat, not on the throne of David in that particular verse, but he sat on the throne of Jehovah. So what Adonijah was really after was the throne of Jehovah, the displacement of Jehovah in the midst of His people.
R.G.B. In relation to Zadok, you seem to have a peculiar feature of loyalty brought forward in the way that he is mentioned in the book of Ezekiel. It says he "kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me" (chapter 44: 15), as if that element of loyalty in the midst of a dark background is peculiarly presented in Zadok, would you say?
S.McC. That is remarkable, showing how God values secret history with Himself. It is a question of where we are with Him in crises, where we are not deflected, or disaffected by natural feelings of emotion. Zadok was free from all these and was in line with
{348}
God's movements in regard of the man of His choice, and God values that.
P.H.H. What would you say about Bath-sheba as needing to be adjusted two or three times in this chapter in Kings?
S.McC. I suppose it alludes to a state in the saints that is weak. It may be in any locality, for we work out all these things practically in our localities. David is weak on the line of kingship publicly and in authority, and Bath-sheba is weak; so that you might say it is a condition of things in which, if nothing intervenes, the whole spirit of what is antichristian in the way of principles and the like that belong to his system, will bring in disaster. But we find that Benaiah is there, and Zadok is there; and they operate in relation to Bath-sheba, and bring her into line with the divine thought.
A.H. Would you say what you understand is represented in Benaiah, he makes a remarkable statement in verses 36 and 37?
S.McC. He does. "And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, Amen". That is very fine. How he says, "Jehovah the God of my lord the king, say so too. As Jehovah has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David". Then we get Benaiah with the Cherethites and the Pelethites; that is the bodyguard, those that stand around Solomon's couch, and protect the great divine thought in Solomon.
-- .L. Are these men some of the fixed ones to use your expression?
S.McC. Yes. God can rely on them in the hour of crisis.
-- .L. They are fixed in their hearts and affections and thoughts?
S.McC. I believe that unreliability -- and we all are to feel it, at least I feel it for myself -- unreliability
{349}
in us naturally largely springs from losing sight of Solomon, Christ in this type, as the divine ideal; because everything is fixed in relation to Solomon, God is committed to it. God is committed to Christ; and we want to be fully committed to Christ in this sense too.
-- .L. And may that be one of the reasons why Jehovah loved him, as Jehovah looked, shall we say, ahead?
S.McC. In the sense in which Christ would be in the divine mind, yes. In @2 Samuel 12 the love of Jehovah stands related to what was in the babe there. Of course it would operate right through, but the whole point is the unique reference that is not made of any other babe, that Jehovah loved him. It was what was there in the babe.
E.J.H. Is it continual fixedness in constantly changing circumstances that is such a test to us?
S.McC. It is. You feel that, for next week or next month, or next year, we do not know from which side the enemy will approach, and will shake us to our foundations as to where we are in regard to Solomon, where we are in regard to Christ, the Man of God's purpose and counsel. And if we are not in line with God, we shall build up our hopes and our thoughts and our feelings and our affections in regard to the man that is sure to come to disaster; and we will lose our way.
A.C.S.P. In that connection, is it not striking that in the chapter Mr. L. referred to, Benaiah shines as one who deals with single great persons? There were not only the two lion-like men of Moab, but an imposing man, an Egyptian. Other mighties dealt with great numbers; but he seemed to deal with personalities.
S.McC. Yes. The flesh loves an imposing man! You see that in your own heart. How the flesh gravitates to what is imposing, what will put a big
{350}
impression on any one of us. We have to reject that completely. We begin with a babe, there is nothing very imposing about a babe. Think of the loveliness of a babe, think of God loving that babe! God would draw us into His secret in relation to Christ so that we might be preserved in that secret from all the antichristian stream and currents that are flowing so swiftly around us.
A.E.B. Do we have to see that the devil himself is behind every one of these rivals, whether it be Adonijah, or Absalom, or whoever it may be? Are not all the activities in connection with Solomon centred in Gihon, but the activities in connection with Adonijah are at the stone Zoheleth, and Zoheleth means "serpent" does it not?
S.McC. Does it? I do not know. I am sure that Gihon is an important point to see here. The word itself means a stream and there were waters, plenty of water in Gihon. The enemy tried to get at it, but Hezekiah diverted it by bringing it underground, as the literal version of it is, in @2 Chronicles 32; he brought it down to the west side of the city of David; that is, where the day was declining, the west side, to strengthen and support the position, it is the Spirit's power.
C.M.M. Would the reference to the trumpet and the pipe remind us of prophetic ministry, the trumpet giving no uncertain sound, and the ministry supporting the greatness of Solomon?
S.McC. Therefore the importance of right leadership. It is important in all these matters that the leaders should be right, so that a right lead is given that all the people can come into, and say "Long live king Solomon". It is all the people.
W.D.D. Were you going to say something about the mule on which he rode?
S.McC. I think it is very fine to see how David's mule comes in here. It would be quite different from
{351}
Absalom's mule. Absalom's mule took him under a tree where he got held up, and it meant the end of him, but David's mule never took him under a tree. David says in verse 33, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule", and then in verse 38 it says they "caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule". I think as you read @2 Samuel 22 and 23, the wonderful song, and then David's references to himself, you see David's mule; you see the way he was carried through, the way he was brought through, and Solomon is to come through on the same mule "thou, Solomon my son, know the God of thy father", @1 Chronicles 28: 9. He is going to be carried through on the same principle that David was carried through on.
P.L. In royal dignity?
S.McC. That is it. Not stooping to the pettiness and meanness of the flesh which breaks out in Joab and Ammon and Absalom, to gain their own selfish end. Royal dignity marks Solomon in this sense. Now we must just have a word as to Chronicles, where we get this thought entering into the chapter where the service of God is in mind, and where the sacrificial side is mentioned earlier. We referred to "And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to *Jehovah*". I think that is a reaction to "and he called his name Jedidiah, for Jehovah's sake". The people now have come to it, so that they anoint him to Jehovah, to be prince; it is what is for Jehovah. Then it says "And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king. And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel". Now we should notice these 'alls', not a rival remains on the
{352}
scene. Where is Absalom? Where is Adonijah? Where is Joab? Where is Ammon? They are all out. "Put every men out from before me", as Joseph said in Genesis: they are all out. We reach a realm and a sphere in the light of God's exalted supremacy where Christ is supreme, and on the throne of Jehovah; and where there is not an adverse or rival element in the realm in relation to Solomon.
G.D. In the first of Colossians, we have "the kingdom of the Son of his love".
S.McC. Yes. All this line is Colossian; we shall see in relation to the ark the Ephesian side. Solomon is the personal side, but the ark brings in the great thought of the system of the truth, the centre of the testimony, the Christ, and the unity of the Spirit. All that is seen officially in Ephesians.
A.E.B. Could you just say a word about this thought of magnification?
S.McC. I think that we want to make room for it, and God would advance on our souls the greatness of Christ. He magnified Joshua, that was in relation to the proximity to the Jordan, but this is a further thought. Christ was magnified in His entrance above, as having, in a military way, in triumph come through. But then, the magnification of Solomon is as sitting on the throne of Jehovah.
P.H.H. Was there a moral warrant for it in the people, that is, that they obeyed him, and they submitted themselves to him? Does that mean that behind all that Jehovah was doing, He had the full support, so to speak, of the saints?
S.McC. That is it. So that there is not an independent thought, or an independent feature in the whole position. This chapter is full of 'alls'. If you go through the chapter, and count the times that 'all' is mentioned in this section, it is impressive. And that is what God is aiming at, nothing less than the whole thought, suggested in *all*. We may have to
{353}
hold to it abstractly, but that is the divine mind -- the all. And things are sustained, not only in relation to Solomon, but the sacrificial side comes in for it says in verse 21 that they offered on the morrow after that day. There is no let down, there is no going back. It is very humbling, and rouses feelings of sorrow and grief in your heart, to think of those that go back on the truth, and go back on what they were originally committed to. But there is nothing of that here.
G.H.S.P. Might the divine thought be set out in Colossians, where it says that all the fulness was pleased to dwell in Christ? Could there be some link there with "Jehovah loved him" -- the pleasure of the Godhead dwelling in Christ as Man?
S.McC. Yes. Colossians shows how Christ is the great central thought. So that in @Colossians 2 it just says, "For in him dwells all the fulness of the Godhead bodily" (verse 9). It is not altogether a mediatorial thought there, it involves that Deity is there, Christ is the expression of Deity in that verse. And there is a link with Solomon on the throne of Jehovah. That is a unique and remarkable reference that we do not find elsewhere, that "Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah". That is, where the supremacy of Jehovah, of God, is moved on to our view, we see Christ in type in Solomon in it, the Man on the throne.
{354}
SPIRITUAL INWARDNESS (2)
@2 Samuel 15: 23 - 30: @1 Kings 3: 10 - 16, 28; @2 Chronicles 5: 7 - 14
S.McC. As was intimated this morning, we are considering what would make for spiritual inwardness amongst us in the assembly, in line with David building round from the Millo and inward. It was thought that the two lines of the truth as to Christ presented so peculiarly in the sections we have been reading from have this in mind, namely the building up of the saints inwardly in relation to another world, and particularly in view of the service of God. We considered Solomon personally this morning, and now we get the parallel line of truth as to Christ in the thought of the ark. Of course, in Scripture the ark is a very great subject, entering into many books, but we hope to confine ourselves to the way the ark is presented in the passages that we have read. The line of truth linked with Solomon, as we considered this morning, links with Colossians, the great place that Christ acquires in the hidden position, inwardly in the souls of the saints. That is, Colossians has in mind the hidden position. And it is to act as a preservative over against all the philosophy and vain deceit and manipulation of the truth linked with the mind of man. So that you have the thought of headship in Solomon in a certain sense, which corresponds. But now in connection with the ark, in relation to the passages that we have read, we have Christ more on our view testimonially and officially, as we have been taught, and Ephesians links with this. Ephesians leads the saints into the apprehension of Christ in a peculiar way, as the Centre of the whole scope of the truth, the Centre of the testimony, the Centre of the vastness of the divine
{355}
domain. So that in the passage that we read, dispensationally, in the type, there is conveyed to us the thought of the rejection of Christ. David has been rejected, just as the Lord Jesus has died and has risen from the dead, and has gone into heaven. David represents that side of the truth here. Christ as rejected and gone into heaven. But then, as often has been said, there is that which is left here, the Spirit of God comes into the Acts in relation to what is here, in relation to what is fixed and eternal, from one point of view what God commits Himself to in connection with Jerusalem and the ark. This is a great means of stability in our souls as we apprehend Christ in this way, over against the state of things around us, and in which we have our part publicly. We have to see the place that the ark and Jerusalem have, secretly in a hidden way, in this whole matter. Faith would apprehend the great thoughts of God linked with Christ testimonially in this sense. That is, the Spirit has come down, and there is the thought of the ark in relation to Jerusalem. The testimony of God is maintained in a hidden inward secret way in the power of the Spirit, the unity of the Spirit entering into it. We thus have what is fixed and eternal, and abstractly never can be violated, it remains inviolate. And David here apprehends the importance of this, and conveys the importance of it, because they went out bearing the ark of the covenant of God, and David says "Carry back the ark of God into the city". That is, there is a fixed position, and an abiding position which must not be interfered with. And stability is linked with that position, whatever the power of evil may be, as suggested in Absalom and his system, involving the dethroning of David, and the rejection of David. Despite the reproach linked with the position, Christ outside, we are always to see spiritually that there is an inside position linked with Christ in testimony and the assembly. And the
{356}
unity of the Spirit is linked with that. If we do not hold that, we shall drift into sectarianism, schismatic thoughts and feelings. We want to see that whatever has happened in the dispensation, that the ark and Jerusalem remain; the ark abides, and it is to be held in that relation. There is nothing less than that, that is, it is the whole scope of the truth in regard to Christ and the assembly. And nothing less than that is to govern us. Now, the apprehension of Christ in this light is very important, as building us up inwardly over against the drift and the departure that enters into the operation of antichristian principles that are in the context in these chapters.
P.L. Do the references to the testimony of our Lord in 2 Timothy, and the seven-fold allusion to the expression "in Christ Jesus" in that same epistle bear on what is before you, in the way of fixity?
S.McC. Yes. Whatever may have come into the dispensation in the way of ruin and breakdown, it never alters what is in Christ Jesus. Then there is not only that, but in that same setting we have the foundation of God; it stands firm, it is sure.
G.H.S.P. Might there be some link at all with your two thoughts in that John's gospel gives us the glory of the Person of Christ, and John's epistle brings in what has been established substantially as in the expression "that which was from the beginning"?
S.McC. I think so. There is a definite link in John's writings, because the ark is the centre of the truth, "the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus". All the way down from Genesis to Revelation we have the testimony of Jesus. And the ark represents Christ as the centre of the truth, the centre of prophetic thoughts, the centre of the whole mind of God. And we are to be held in relation to that. Like the ark, John stresses the truth, the ark makes way for itself. Even suppose there is no-one there by it, the ark makes way for itself, just as the truth
{357}
makes way for itself, as John's ministry conveys to us.
A.H. Is there any importance in the way the city is referred to in these verses? He says in verse 25, Carry it back into the city, and then he sends Hushai back into the city. It says in verse 37, "And Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem".
S.McC. I think there is. The city is the great divine thought in regard to the ark. It represents a fixed order of things, that however great may be the power and influence of what is antichristian, this is maintained, and the knowledge of Christ in this way is important, as over against all that is so unstable and so shifting in what we have to do with publicly.
A.C.S.P. Does it link with the expression in @Ephesians 3: 17 "that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts", and then what follows, "rooted and founded in love"?
S.McC. Exactly, and following up, in chapter 4, with the unity of the Spirit. We have these great thoughts of what is fixed and abiding, and the idea of rooted, in chapter 3, links with that.
P.L. In the first scripture in Samuel, the ark is called the ark of God, and it is called later, in the other Scriptures, the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. Is the first to assert against the great imitation, alluding to the foundation of God in 2 Timothy? And is the reference to the ark of Jehovah, that God is now free, in propitious conditions, to open out the thoughts in Christ, in His faithful love?
S.McC. I think so. The ark of Jehovah would link on with God's relations with His people, too, would it not?
S.R. It says "Where two or three are gathered together unto my name, there am I in the midst of them". Is that a suggestion of the ark in the city?
S.McC. I think it is. @Matthew 18 helps us to
{358}
cling to assembly thoughts, to full thoughts -- not any half or quarter thoughts, but full thoughts. Even supposing the number is reduced to the lowest possible, we cling to assembly thoughts. We see that as far as the testimonial Christ is concerned, it must be linked with the city, and with the ordered state of things in that relation.
P.H.H. Is it remarkable that Saul of Tarsus, having been spoken to by the Lord, was directed to rise up and go into the city? Would he gain fresh light and direction from there?
S.McC. He would. Because there was an order of things linked with the city there, where he would come under direction and control. We might say, of course, the Lord is in heaven. Yes, the Lord is in heaven, but everything is not in heaven. I speak reverently and soberly, but at the Glanton division, there were the leaders who said that everything had gone into heaven, and that there was nothing down here. That is not scriptural. And there are those today that say there is nothing down here; they say it is nothing but ruin and breakdown, and everything is on individual lines. That is not according to Scripture. The Spirit of God is here, Christ testimonially is here, the ark is here in relation to Jerusalem, and the city.
P.H.H. So the Lord was really drawing attention to what was fixed, although down here in the sphere of the opposition?
S.McC. That is it -- fixed in the testimonial position. Think of the power of Christ testimonially in the Acts, in the early days; every city fell before that power! Well, what we are brought back to in days of recovery and revival is the same Christ testimonially as was there in the Acts.
G.W.B. When Paul says "So also is the Christ" (@1 Corinthians 12: 12), is he not referring to what is down here?
{359}
S.McC. That is, there is the anointed system that God is committed to, in which all His thoughts are set out in an ordered manner and way in this world.
R.W.S. Is there room in this system for all? There is Zadok and Abiathar, and Hushai, and Ahimaaz, and Jonathan; the whole range of persons in their spiritual personalities and ages comes into the matter, does it not?
S.McC. I think that is very important, because we see right leadership in David. Right leadership will see that the young are brought rightly into matters, and that they are not just there standing looking on, but they are brought in as an integral part of this fixed system of things that is operating, and that God is committed to. David will come back to it. Absalom's power may seem supreme, and David may be outside, and we go forth unto him, as rejected, on the one side of the truth. But then on the other side of the truth, in the light of these five persons you referred to, we stand linked with Christ in the testimonial position, holding the ground in relation to the fixed system of things in the unity of the Spirit.
E.J.H. And is that the guarantee that every enemy will be overthrown, and the King will be finally in His own place in glory?
S.McC. That is it. And it brings the element of victory into our souls, so that we do not succumb to the strong currents and movements of antichristian principles, principles of unbelief and lawlessness.
E.J.H. So that "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love, and of wise discretion", @2 Timothy 1: 7?
S.McC. Just so.
P.H.H. Is that hinted at in the mount of Olives? It says, "David went up by the ascent of the Olives, and wept as he went up", but had he, in the Spirit, a great outlet towards victory, holding the ground?
S.McC. And is not that to help us to see the great
{360}
need of the recognition of what is linked with the Spirit in this suggestion of the Olives? In a day of ruin and breakdown, we come back to what is linked with the Spirit, because it is the testimonial Christ in the ark here. It is not the ark in the holiest, exactly at the moment, it is the ark back into the city; it is the administrative order of things, where the testimony is maintained in secret in a hidden way over against the power of the enemy. But it can only be in the reserves that are linked with the Spirit as suggested in the Olives, do not you think?
P.H.H. Yes, I was thinking that. There must be great power, and a great system suggested in the *ascent* of the Olives. It speaks in the New Testament, does it not, of the *mount* of the Olives, as if it were a great stable system.
S.McC. Well, what could be more stable than what is linked with the antitype in that sense, the presence of the Spirit? It would help us not to throw up our hands, in the sense of an impasse or the sense of 'What can we do?' The mount of Olives is there, and there is the seemly behaviour and deportment of David in keeping with it.
A.C.S.P. So that while David speaks in a measure guardedly about himself, as to what God might do with him, he speaks with certainty about the ark, as he says, "Bring me again and show me it, and its habitation".
S.McC. It is very important to see how he speaks of it, and its habitation. He does not give up that ground for a moment, whatever the power of Absalom may be. If there is anything that has been a full exposure of the antichristian principles operating in the world, and the lack in the apprehension of the truth, it is seen in the independent breaking of breads that have been set up by those that have departed from the truth.
P.L. Would you say that the priestly regard for
{361}
the ark, in verse 25, and the humble submission to God's government "let him do to me as seemeth good to him", furnish a combination in manhood that indicates moral recovery already, and assures final recovery?
S.McC. That is it. You might say in those verses the full recovery is assured, that David will come back. That is God will bring David back, it says "he will bring me again". It is a beautiful thought -- "He will bring me again", not 'I will come again', but "He will bring me again". "If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah, he will bring me again". That is, it is a question of what God is to do.
P.L. Is it a heart-broken churchman that writes second Timothy, and that speaks so much of this line of sovereign love and mercy, and all the stability attaching to us, do you think?
S.McC. Yes. And do you not think in that sense that the testimonial Christ, in the ark in this setting is the great test of every one of us. That is, How do we stand in relation to it? If we are not affected rightly by Christ in the testimony in this sense, then we are making everything of ourselves. We are the centre of our thoughts, and we are the centre of divine thoughts, instead of seeing that the ark and the city represent abstractly, the fixed and eternal thoughts of God.
G.H.S.P. You are connecting Christ testimonially with each local position?
S.McC. Just so. The testimonial Christ entered into Corinth, the testimonial Christ entered into Thessalonica, entered into Ephesus, and so on; and every power was brought down before the testimonial Christ, in the movements of the ark in that sense.
R.G.B. Does the unity of the Spirit that you referred to, link on with that? Is that something that abides in the Spirit here, and that we are to endeavour to keep? It cannot be broken into itself,
{362}
for the presence of the Spirit ensures the unity of the Spirit.
S.McC. That is it.
R.G.B. And we are to endeavour to keep it.
S.McC. It is a great thing to apprehend that abstractly, a great thing for the young people. Oh, that God might open their eyes to see this wonderful hidden secret side of things in which Christ is apprehended mysteriously, and yet in testimony! But in relation to which everything is held for God.
A.H. Is that involved in what David adds, "it, and its habitation"? Is that seen in every locality?
S.McC. Yes. What the enemy would say is there is no habitation today, that is, things are in so much ruin, and breakdown that there is no habitation. But there *is* a habitation; there *is* the ark, and there *is* its habitation, and we want to find it.
A.H. Are you thinking that that is the fixed position, and as known in the soul it involves the overthrow of Absalom and Ahithophel?
S.McC. Yes. Jerusalem in this sense is eternal. That is, while it is provisionally in testimony, it is an eternal order of things that will go right through. All the power of antichrist, and the operating principles linked with him, will never break in upon this inviolate unity that our brother has referred to in @Ephesians 4.
G.H.M. Does the transfiguration suggest the ark in its own position?
S.McC. That is not the ark in the testimonial position; it is the ark in the scene of glory and would link more with what we read in @2 Chronicles 5, the final thought.
W.McK. In regard to this verse "he will bring me again", might not that suggest the Philadelphian recovery? And is it not remarkable that the Lord
{363}
speaks to the overcomer of the temple of my God, and of the city of my God; linking it on with his own thoughts?
S.McC. That is very good. That is just what we have here, the "bring me again" is that things have been brought back in Philadelphia, to what we have here. That is, there is the ark in its proper place, and the city had its proper place; there are no half or quarter thoughts in Philadelphia, it is all the assembly or nothing. It is no segment, it is no few brethren. In Philadelphia we have got the full thought of the assembly in the Lord's mind, and we want to cling to that.
P.L. "He that has the key of David" commences the Philadelphian epistle, does it not?
S.McC. And "the holy, the true". What a contrast to what is in the antichristian system and environment!
J.W.B. There is nothing outside this system you are speaking of, is there? Are not those that would seek to go off on independent lines really heading for what is spoken of as systematised error, according to @Ephesians 4?
S.McC. Yes. The folly of it would be apparent to those who are with God, not that we need to waste precious time speaking about those that are gone. Like David, we feel things; our heads should be covered, and the barefoot condition comes into view. It is all that which would be contrary to any natural feelings, what would be seemly in the sight of God as we feel the sorrow of the whole position. And yet we cling to Christ apprehended in this mysterious inward way.
P.H.H. Is it interesting that worship is mentioned here? It says in verse 32, "when David had come to the summit, where he worshipped God". Is that one of the features which the Lord has graciously
{364}
left with us, and promoted with us, even to completion, the worshipping of God, and the full recognition of the hidden position, in spite of all the breakdown?
S.McC. So that these thoughts are very fine in the setting in which they are here. They are like gems in this dark background where things are dislocated by the power of antichristian influence.
P.H.H. Is it not important that it is on this very matter of the worship of God that fresh departures have been noticed? But while that is so, the worship of God itself is strengthened amongst us. We feel we are being sustained in it, if we may speak humbly.
S.McC. It is very interesting in that way, verse 31, "Then said David, Jehovah, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. And it came to pass, when David had come to the summit, where he worshipped God". That is, it does not say he worshipped *Jehovah*, the name or title used is *God*, alluding, I suppose, to the sense of God's supremacy in his soul, in the midst of these difficult conditions and circumstances.
A.E.M. I would like to say this, that in verse 30 David and his men were weeping as they went up. We understand weeping as we go down, but do we understand weeping as we go up?
S.McC. Very good. That is, we generally link weeping with going down into the valley, like the valley of Baca in @Psalm 84, but here weeping is linked with the summit of the mount of Olives. That is a very fine reference, showing that the nearer we get to God, would you say, the more we feel things about the dislocation?
A.E.M. I think so.
R.W.S. Having its beginning in the torrent Kidron, do you think? Is there some allusion there to the death of the Lord Jesus?
S.McC. I think that is very important. In type the ministry of the cross, the ministry of the death
{365}
of Christ, is so near in this environment. It is that ministry that would free us from the features of the man of sin and shame, that have dethroned David, that have given Christ the outside place. We need to see the nearness, the proximity of that, in this realm.
E.J.H. It was not at all an attractive place for all these little ones. Is it not encouraging to see how many small ones are identified with a weeping testimony from one point of view?
S.McC. Well, it is. It is very interesting throughout the Scriptures in that way, as we go down through the Scriptures, to see the tears that are linked with the testimony in circumstances of pressure and reproach. Well, perhaps we need to know something more about the ability to weep, as Mr. M. has been saying, not only going down, in regard to our circumstances, personally, but in the going up in what affects God, in what the enemy has sought to do in putting his hand on the throne of Jah.
P.L. They are written in a book, are they not; they are so precious to God?
S.McC. And preserved in a bottle, is that so? @Psalm 56: 8, "put my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?" That is, they are preserved; God would preserve the precious testimony to inwrought feelings by His own work, in those that are sympathetic with Him in relation to all the damage that the enemy has done.
A.L.R.T. Would Timothy's tears in @2 Timothy 1 come in there?
S.McC. Yes. The tears of Timothy bear on the darkening state of things in the assembly, and how the enemy has wrought. I am sure it is important that we all should see the ark in relation to the city in this relation, it brings out the greatness of David, and the intelligence of the man. We might say he falls under the power of sin in the book, and his
{366}
affections get misplaced as to Absalom, but that is only but a salutary warning to every one of us, how easily our affections may be misplaced. But then there are these breakings through, where we see what the man is, rising according to God, to the truth, and to the importance of the truth where the truth has been assailed. That is what we need in leadership, for a leader leads. A leader is not a man that just sits on a platform, he may sit on a platform, but a leader leads. Leadership is nothing if there is not the leading. So that David leads here, for all the people that were with them covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. What David does, they do.
J.W.B. So does leadership involve example?
S.McC. It does. That is, the matter is set on in leadership, so that the saints do not lose their way. I mean, we are not a democracy in that sense; leadership is essential, so that the saints should not lose their way; we do not want to be afraid of the thought of leadership.
P.H.H. What is presented in the direction for Hushai to go into the city? Is it like the lead to connect us with the system known in secret?
S.McC. That is it. The ark and its habitation in the city represent the abstract side, but the five persons represent the concrete side that is in a locality. You must cling to the abstract side, otherwise you will never be able to work out the truth in the day of brokenness, but then there is the concrete side, there are the persons, and five is the numeral of human dependency and weakness.
P.H.H. Would the friendship side in Hushai represent personal loyalty in attachment to David more than what is official?
S.McC. Yes, exactly. A very important side of the truth, that there should be good personal relations in crises. If there is anything that the enemy works
{367}
hard to do, it is to develop bad personal relations between the brethren, and if bad personal relations are developed in localities, we may lose the position, as it were. Paul, when he went to Galatia to combat, and to enter into the conflict regarding the truth, lays great stress on good personal relations. He went up to make Peter's acquaintance.
E.J.H. So here, would you say, each one has his own work to do, but they are all working in perfect harmony with one end in view, and that is the glory of David?
S.McC. So that both lines of the truth that we have been considering lead into unity. Where the saints are being built up inwardly in the knowledge of Christ in these relations, it will always lead to unification among them. What leads to disunity amongst us is when the affections get misplaced, and when the wrong man becomes the centre. Only Christ can be the Centre of unity in the sphere of God.
A.H. Does @Psalm 132 help at all in these exercises here, seen in David, do you think?
S.McC. It does, and @Psalm 133, they are of a piece in that way, the unity of the Spirit the central place that the ark has.
P.L. And @Psalm 134?
S.McC. Exactly, the service of God, you mean?
P.L. Those who stand by night in the house of the Lord. This is the night time.
G.H.S.P. Is this light in the soul vital if we are to have any part in the maintenance of prophetic ministry? I was thinking of Zechariah, in the days of recovery in which he lived; he was asked what he saw, and he said, "I see a lamp-stand all of gold" -- a living system functioning in the power of the Spirit. Does that bear at all on what you are saying?
S.McC. Well, it does, very much; so notice how it comes in here, verse 27, "And the king said to
{368}
Zadok the priest, Thou art the seer", well, that is an important thing, that we should see this. David is bringing Zadok back to this, the hidden system linked with the ark and the city that Absalom does not understand, the mind of man never will understand; but linked with it is the power of God. The ark is not exactly, in this setting, an object of affection, it is not to draw out the love, so much, of the brethren, it is linked more with the side of power and glory; power in testimony, and glory entering into the final side.
E.C.L. Do you think when we assemble together for the Supper (I am thinking of going up from our houses), there should be these kind of feelings where we are breaking bread, and where the service of God is carried on, to free us from all that is outside?
S.McC. I am sure that is right. And as we sit together in the testimonial position we watch the brethren coming in. We do not sit looking at the floor, we are looking for the brethren coming in, and see them take their seats, and we look at the loaf, and we see that some are missing, some are not there. Well, we have got to have right feelings about that; but then, because they are not there we do not cease, we do not cease to go on, for the position suggested in the ark and the city is maintained, and we go on, while we feel the loss of those that are absent, that are represented in the loaf.
E.C.L. So that the going on would mean that you are holding the ground for everyone that belongs to the Lord. The loaf would include all that, would it not?
S.McC. That is it. It is not that we claim to be the assembly, that would be pretentious, and the enemy is seeking to accuse the brethren of the utmost pretension, that is another device of the enemy. Philadelphia is that believers have returned through the Lord's own service and the service of
{369}
the Spirit, to stand in the truth proper to the *whole* assembly. They will not have anything less than that, what belongs to the whole assembly, and that is not pretension.
-- .H. Would it be right to say that if any of us are there in effect really, we are there as brought there, even as David says, "he will bring me again"?
S.McC. I think that is the thought. We have got a sense of the sovereignty of God in the matter, that He has brought us again. That covers the whole period of the last 150 years, that God has brought us again. That is, Christ is brought back in testimony in the power of the Spirit, and the position is maintained in that light.
R.W.S. It speaks of the man at Bahurim in the next chapter, verse 18, but it also speaks of the woman in verse 19, and it speaks of the maid in verse 17. I was thinking thus of the sister's part. Sometimes in a financial crisis the wife has to work as well as the husband, but that is not to be a characteristic thing, is it? It would possibly weaken the testimony in a place. I mean work outside of the home.
S.McC. That is, the sister's place is the home. There may be circumstances in which a sister has to work, to meet obligations where illness may have come in, and certain circumstances, but the sister's place is the home, and especially is it weakening in the testimonial position if brothers who are leading in any way, or ministering among the saints, have their wives working.
R.W.S. Because the whole position at the moment hinged on what she did, and what the maid did.
S.McC. Yes. In forestalling and operating against the movement of the enemy, you mean?
A.L.R.T. Do the circumstances in chapter 15 bring out true friendship for Christ as in Hushai?
{370}
I was thinking of @3 John 14, "The friends greet thee, Greet the friends by name". Would that link?
S.McC. It is important to see how friendship comes in in that way and in the epistles you refer to, because, what is the bond between David and Hushai? Hushai is in the city, he is linked with the testimonial Christ in the ark, the official Christ in type in David is outside, rejected, He is in heaven. What is the link between the two? It is the ark, it is the truth, the centre of the truth, the centre of the testimony. And we are to see that. A lot has been said in our time about the truth being made an issue. Well, if we are not held together by the bond of the truth, what is going to hold us together? It is not only that Christ is the bond of the fellowship, but John's epistles show us that the truth is a bond, in the fellowship.
P.L. Hushai's name means quick; does it suggest alertness and agility in a crisis?
S.McC. Yes.
P.L. And the word 'Archite' means one who continues, length; does it refer to such as John, who would continue in character until the Lord came?
S.McC. Exactly.
P.H.H. Do you think the characteristics governing David in this time were, so to speak, passed on to Solomon, so that he asks for wisdom and discernment and understanding? Would that ensure that the next generation is able to do battle in a crisis, and stand?
S.McC. So that you would say that what we read in @1 Kings 3 is a kind of a reflection in Solomon of what was seen in David in chapter 15 of 2 Samuel in that sense. That is, Solomon came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark. That is the thing has got into Solomon's soul, and right leadership in that sense will always pass that on into those who come to fill up the ranks.
{371}
P.H.H. I was thinking that, and the references several times to David my father, show where he had got this wisdom. That is, there have been brethren who have preceded us, in whom the truth has been built and established, and we have come into the recognition of that. Is that how we stand before the ark now?
S.McC. That is it. In relation to all that has gone before, we are to notice the unity of the testimony, for the testimony is one. While there may be fresh moves in the testimony, the testimony is one whole, and so, what we come into is just that one whole, although we may come into a different phase of it. So that what is said of Solomon here, I think, brings out a real touch of his greatness; he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant. And there is nothing said beyond that he offered up burnt-offerings. Well, in connection with the burnt-offerings, you would have thought it would have said that he came and stood before the altar, but it does not say that. It says, "He came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and offered up burnt-offerings". It is prefaced by his not asking for riches, or long life, but asking for a wise and understanding heart, and for discernment.
A.H. Does this test that comes in immediately show his wisdom to discover affection for the man-child?
S.McC. It does. And I think that only a person who in that sense, has stood before the ark has a moral right to bring in what the sword represents. It is very fine to see that it follows him standing before the ark, and the judgment that is arrived at is binding on all Israel. It says "And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do justice".
{372}
P.H.H. Referring to this matter of Solomon offering up these burnt-offerings. The brazen altar was at Gibeon, was it not, and according to the opening of 2 Chronicles, the tent of meeting was there, and so on; and Solomon offered up many offerings there, on the brazen altar? Does it show that, in what it means for us, Solomon has got on, and come to something that is substantial in regard of Christ in the ark itself, not in the altar?
S.McC. That is how I understand it. It is not the high places here, he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah. It is the truth abstractly apprehended in its fixed relation and setting in connection with God.
P.H.H. Yes, thank you. I thought something like that.
E.J.H. And standing there, would you say, it is intolerable to think of anyone wishing to divide the living child?
S.McC. Just so. Because the ark is the centre of unity, it is the centre of unity in Israel. It is the centre of the unity of the truth, and the testimony; it is the great bond of the whole position. How could such a thought as division come in, if you are standing before the ark.
G.D. Does Josiah understand that, in days of recovery when he says put the holy ark in the house that Solomon built for it?
S.McC. What he said about that is very interesting. Of course, that would be the full thought that would be in mind there. In what we have here, the ark would be in the tent that David had spread for it. But the last revival is marked by recovery to what was seen under Solomon in that sense, the ark in its proper place.
G.H.S.P. Would you say another word as to what you had in mind in saying it is only as standing before
{373}
the ark that we shall have any right or ability to use the sword?
S.McC. I think we are all measured by Christ. Christ is the test of every man, and if we do not stand before the ark, we will be like Adonijah, we will have runners going before us, paving the way for us, and our prowess and renown. Whereas a man that stands before the ark has got no runners going before him; he is not spreading his own renown and prowess. He is in the presence of what may be small to the human eye, and the human mind, but what is the great centre of the universe of God, the Christ, in @Ephesians 3. It strips you of all thought of self, does it not?
G.H.S.P. Yes, indeed. I wondered if you had also in mind that it is only as the divine thought of the assembly of God is laid hold of by us that we shall have power to deal with these uprisings that you allude to.
S.McC. I think so. That is, the sword brings in the death of Christ. The torrent Kidron brings in the death of Christ in another setting. Now the death of Christ in the sword comes in in another relation. But only one who stands before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah -- notice "the covenant of Jehovah" is brought in here -- can rightly bring in the sword. It says, "They saw that the wisdom of God was in him". What a marvellous statement! It is like Jehovah loving the Babe. We have not got a babe here now; we have got manhood in Solomon. But the wisdom of God was *in* him. It is a remarkable statement in the Old Testament, before Christ came. It anticipates Christ, because *He* was the One in whom wisdom was set out perfectly. But it does not say here that the wisdom of God was *with* Solomon; it says "the wisdom of God was *in* him, to do justice". That is, it is the inwardness that we are stressing,
{374}
the question of spiritual inwardness with us, as to matters of administration.
R.G.B. Would that link with the all-various wisdom of God being seen by the principalities and powers in the heavenlies working in the assembly down here, the result of the presence of the Spirit?
S.McC. That is it. The ark in Jerusalem, in verse 15, and the wisdom of God in Solomon in the last verse, all link with that marvellous order and system of things in @Ephesians 3. So that the heavenly intelligences are learning from the skill and wisdom employed in this system of things here below.
W.J.T. Is it important that in verse 7 he has small thoughts about himself, and in verse 8 he has great thoughts about God's people?
S.McC. Very good. Would to God we had more small thoughts about ourselves. We have got such big thoughts about ourselves, prefigured in men like Joab, and Adonijah, and Absalom. Oh, how Absalom thinks of himself! He injects poison into the minds of the people, that their matters were not being taken care of. They are not bringing your matters up as they should, he would say. It seems nice in one way, but it is injecting poison into the minds of the brethren, so that Christ is displaced. Absalom did not have any small thought about himself. But of Solomon, it says, "And the word pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing". "I am but a little child: I know not to go out and to come in. And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen". It is very fine language.
P.L. Would "less than the least of all saints" be the spirit so pleasing to God, that the great unfoldings of Ephesians would be given to such a man?
S.McC. Is it not striking how that comes in there? Over against the greatness of the dispensations that Paul had, he speaks of himself as less than
{375}
the least of all saints. I take it that that is Solomon standing before the ark. Paul was a true Solomon who stood before the ark, and who could bring in the sword like Paul? How he would save the situation at Corinth on this principle. The enemy would divide, bring in the schism, but Paul had nothing less than the whole thought in mind, "the assembly of God which is in Corinth".
P.L. "Oh, lowliness, how feebly known, That meets the grace that gave the Son!"
S.McC. Very good. How the writer of that was marked by such lowliness, a man that stood before the ark, you might say, in Jerusalem. Well, the time has gone. Just the thought in the final resting place of the ark, as to the unity that is arrived at, and the service of God augmented. You can see how all these thoughts of the ark, and the passages of the ark, and David and Solomon in relation to it all enter into this idea of the augmentation of the service of God, and the unity in it amongst the saints.
{376}
THE SPIRIT OF THE BONDMAN
S. McCallum
@John 13: 13 - 16; @Galatians 1: 10; @Exodus 21: 1 - 6 @Genesis 44: 33, 34
My thought is to refer to the spirit of the bondman, having in mind the different ways in which it acts and reacts upon the people of God. It is important that in a selfish age, such as we are in, where all are seeking their own things and not the things of Jesus Christ, we should come under the influence of the Lord Jesus in regard to this spirit of bondmanship. And I have read the passage in @John 13 to begin with the Lord Himself. He wants to help the disciples by way of the model or example He has given, and we are all to be helped by this way. Our Lord is the Model in many things. Peter tells us of the model that He has left for us in regard to suffering, so that we should follow in His steps. Many of us shirk suffering but the Lord went to all the pains of leaving us a model that we should follow in His steps. A model involves a good deal of expenditure, and a good deal of care and forethought, and a good deal of energy and labour. And the Lord has undertaken all this, so that we might be fully furnished with that which we can follow in Himself, follow in His steps. And so in regard to the great thought of bondmanship, we have an example and a model in the Lord Himself. It is inscrutable to the human mind to think that One who had co-equal, co-eternal part in Deity with the Father and the Spirit, should not only come into the condition of humanity, in the marvellous stoop in grace that He took, but that He should take on what is more, the form of a bondman. Because bondman's form is not proper to man, ordinarily, normally; it is an additional thought. And the
{377}
Lord emptied Himself, taking a bondman's form. We might well pause in the presence of that, and marvel at Him whose name is Wonderful, Mighty God, as Isaiah refers to Him, coming before us, as He does, in bondman's form. And having taken that form, serving in it so devotedly, so faithfully, with no consideration for Himself, but with every consideration for others. We are tested by Christ, dear brethren, every one of us is tested as to how much we are in His presence, as to how much our souls absorb the spirit and grace of that glorious Person that came in such unselfish love, into these circumstances of limitation. They were not imposed upon Him, never for a moment could we contemplate that. He voluntarily, being who He was and who He is, entered upon bondman form. In emptying Himself He took it; it was not laid upon Him, it was not imposed upon Him. He took it. Think of the grace of it, dear brethren.
Now in this chapter that we have read from He is seen in the exercise of service towards His own; they are referred to as His own in this world in this chapter: "having loved his own who were in the world". How delightful to nestle into the blessedness of that expression "his own" -- those loved by Christ, in a world where antichristian influences are so strong, and where we have been cast out from the ordinary society of men! What a wonderful thing to nestle into the sweetness and preciousness of being part of "His own", that wonderful circle where Christ has those that love Him, still in the world, but not of it. And He is on the way out of it. I believe, dear brethren, that in the service that He carried out in His love in this chapter, He is conscious that He is going out of it, and I believe it is very near and next His heart that we are going out of it too, and He wants to help us out of it. Feet-washing, in this sense in which I am speaking of it, would be
{378}
to help us out of the world, I mean morally and spiritually. And the Lord sets out the example for us in this lowly bondman service. The spirit of the bondman shines so lustrously in this chapter; Satan is so near, evil is in such proximity, unfaithfulness in Judas is so apparent, yet we are in the presence of the lustre of a love that will not be dimmed, however strong the force and power of evil may be. We are in the presence of a love that is concentrating upon its own, and will serve us, not only in the particular circumstance we are in, but serve us right through to the end. Oh, dear brethren, the love of Jesus our Lord, our Teacher! It is not only that He can lay out the teaching, that He can disclose for us in the wondrous character of His doctrine that He refers to in this gospel, "My doctrine is not mine" (chapter 7: 16), and who could be more able to lay out the wondrous teaching that Jesus laid out in regard to God? But, dear brethren, He is showing us an example here, in the laying aside of His garments, and the girding of Himself; He is taking up the attitude to serve. We like to be served, and it is wonderful to be served by the Lord, but in regard to one another, the Lord wants to inculcate the desire into our hearts to serve one another. It says in Galatians, "but by love serve one another", and the spirit of bondmanship enters into this. The Lord is free from all the selfishness that marks us, for He stands out unique, not considering Himself or what was due to Himself, but removing His garments and getting down to the feet of the disciples, because I believe He wants us out of the world, dear brethren. And I believe He wants us to help one another to get out of the world, morally and spiritually. The world has a great hold on us in more ways than one, and, on the eve of translation, the Lord is seeking to loosen the hold of the world upon us, in whatever form it may be. If it be material thoughts and
{379}
material matters, as to which Laodicea is increased with them, the Lord wants us to be free of the world in this sense. What matters all this social security we may build up, and the reserve for social security, if we have not come into the gain of the truth as He is about to unfold it. And the feet-washing preparatory to it, in this section, is that we can have part with Him.
All these references to this spirit of bondmanship stand at the portal and on the threshold of certain things. In @John 13 we are at the portal, or on the threshold, of the opening out of the truth as to the new and the heavenly order of things; and the Lord wants us there, to have full part with Him in it. He is on the way out of the world, and He would impress our hearts that He is going out of the world, and as our affections are entwined around Him, dear brethren, we will want to go out of the world too. Soon we shall go out of it actually and literally, but we need to go out of it morally and spiritually now. It is needful that the links that hold us in it might be more and more loosened, the power of what is material, and all that is linked with the material side, and the Lord would help us. He is going to the Father, He came out from God and He is going to God, and Satan comes into the way, to stand athwart it, operating through one so near to Christ, a familiar friend, one who carried the bag, one who knew what it was to have a place amongst those that were with Jesus. How the enemy operates, not only from the outside in, but from the inside out. And every one of us, dear brethren, is to be conscious of the need, the constant need of self-judgment in the power of the Spirit of God, that the doors of our hearts may be shut against any entrenchment of Satan on them, to displace the place that Christ has. And the Lord washes their feet, and He says, "I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should
{380}
do also". Do we help one another along this way, this way that leads to glory, that way which is upward still, where life and glory are? Where are our interests? Where are our affections? Where is our time? Where is our energy spent? Is it concentrated on this way which is upward still, that leads to where life and glory are? Or is it in our families, in our businesses? We were speaking about wives working today; how sad it is to see persons that want to be independent; they want to build up material goods, and sacrifice the interests of Christ to do so. I have always found, by careful observation, dear brethren, that those who have moved on that line, in the final analysis, years afterwards, they are no better off. Indeed, they are worse off than those that have accepted the path of sacrifice and surrender to devote themselves to the interests of Christ. How many cripple themselves in relation to the heavenly and eternal order of things by taking on far more than they are intended to take on, piety is sacrificed for the desire for what is natural, and the desire for what is material. Young people getting married, as you get engaged, and have in mind marriage, let piety come into your lives, and let piety come into the ascendancy, be satisfied with such things as you have. The spirit of the world that is around us wants more and more of what is material. Let it be gone! "He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal. If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant. And if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour", @John 12: 25, 26. That is said after the bringing of Lazarus out of the tomb, and the glory of the resurrection scene. Another world is in view, Hebron, that world of resurrection from among the dead.
The Greeks come up, and they want to see Jesus; and the Lord sounds the death knell to all Grecian
{381}
hopes, and Grecian aspirations, "He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall *keep it* to life eternal". Think of the wonderful merging in that expression "shall keep it to life eternal". Life eternal is an out-of-the-world condition of relationship and being that John emphasises, and he wants to have us in it. Years ago, 1890, in proximity to that date, the conflict as to eternal life was severe and bitter, and thousands on the Continent and other parts were lost over it. The doctrine of eternal life was the issue; but at the present moment, dear brethren, the issue is not the doctrine of eternal life, the issue is the practical bearing of eternal life, as to whether we are prepared to go out of the world, to know the blessedness more and more of part in that order and condition of blessing that lies in the knowledge of God outside of this world, where the pressure of death is lifted from our spirits. There is a lot of sorrow in bereavement amongst us, a lot of ill-health and sickness, the pressure of death bears in heavily. We feel it, dear brethren, not only in this country, our beloved brethren in Cheltenham, and elsewhere, and to the south of us. But the Lord wants us to be free from that sphere and realm where the pressure of death is felt; He wants to lift us in our spirits into a realm where the pressure of death is lifted -- the realm of eternal life. And the more we see that, the more we shall value the assembly, because the assembly is the great realm in which eternal life is enjoyed. Eternal life is not linked with the wilderness, it does not belong to the wilderness, its effects may work out in the wilderness, in various relationships; but eternal life belongs to the assembly. It belongs to the land, it belongs to the glory of what God has before Him in Christ; it is there in His Son, in the best setting God could possibly give it. He has not placed it in heaven exactly, He has not placed it in
{382}
the assembly, He has placed it in His Son, as John says, "This life is in his Son", @1 John 5: 11. It is in that wonderful order of things, in that setting where divine affection is seen at its best, if I may speak reverently.
Well, I feel the importance in my own soul, dear brethren, of this matter of the upward way that leads out of the world. All the issues as to associations and unions, professional or otherwise, the Lord is raising these matters with us, dear brethren, because He wants us on that upward way. He wants us so that there will not be too much to leave, when His great shout will be heard calling us to be with Himself -- when He Himself shall descend from heaven with archangel's voice and with trump of God. We are going to be with Him, and He wants us with Him now. He wants us to be with Him for ever, but He wants us to be with Him now, morally and spiritually. And I believe the spirit of bondmanship in @John 13 has in mind, as the Lord would inculcate it into us, that we should serve one another in this light, that we should help one another more and more, to get out of the world morally and spiritually, to get more into the spiritual and heavenly side of things where the truth is so wondrous. Think of @John 14, 15, 16 and 17; what a holy realm and environment opens to the view of faith, and for the spirit-taught mind! The Lord wants us in it; He wants us in it with Himself, as having part with Him, dear brethren. The holy devoted servitude in love which marked Him is to mark us in our relations with one another, as He says, "I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also. Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him". Well I leave it, dear brethren. May the Lord help us to serve one another on this line, with the best thoughts in mind, not with the worst thoughts in
{383}
mind, not to draw out the flesh in one another, not to irritate what is natural in one another; but with the best and most holy thoughts in mind, that we should know what it is to enjoy part with Christ more and more. It is not our heads, not our hands, but our feet, the last part that touches the world, as it were, the earth! The Lord wants to have our feet free, and if there is anyone that is in an association, or has a link, in whatever form it may be, that is inconsistent and incompatible with the new and heavenly order of things that the Lord is opening up in all its blessedness, may we make room for love to serve us in the spirit of bondmanship, to wash our feet, and to set us free.
Now when we come to Galatians, I love to think of the spirit of the bondman in Paul. It is not now the spirit of the bondman at the portal, or on the threshold, of the opening up of the truth, but at the portal and on the threshold of conflict for the truth. When we enter into conflict for the truth, what is needed is the spirit of a bondman. Paul says "For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman". What a sense this man had in his soul of being Christ's bondman! Do we have a sense of being a bondman of Christ in this way? You can see Paul as he moves about in Jerusalem, how they would look at him; they had never seen a bondman like him, outside of the Lord. How he would remind them of his Master! He was a man that was moving in relation to his Master, who would never come under the influence of man as man, naturally. As he says, "Do I seek to please men?" If there is anything that we need to be delivered from in the arena of conflict, in the maintenance of the truth, it is from pleasing men! How easy it is to say something to please men, or to temper up or modify something to please men. It is not a question
{384}
of not having an appreciation of what is in one another. Think of Paul as he goes up to Jerusalem, think of his appreciation of Peter! Did he not appreciate what there was in Peter? He certainly did. He went up, as it says, and remained with him fifteen days. I am certain of this, that Paul was not looking at the furniture that Peter had; I do not think he would look at how much there was indication in Peter's circumstances of the means that he had. I do not think so. I think Paul was occupied in Peter, and other bondmen, with the treasury of divine knowledge, what there was divinely made and divinely formed, and he wanted to get the most gain out of that treasury that he could. And he goes up, and remained with him fifteen days. What good personal relations would be promoted in those days. I wonder how you would like someone to come and remain with you fifteen days. Think of it, not two days, or one day; some of us these days visit a good many places, one day here and one day there! But think of remaining fifteen days with Peter. And he says, "I saw none other of the apostles, but James". I do not know whether the others were visiting Peter or not; it would not seem to be the case at that moment; but anyway, Paul was visiting Peter; and he was visiting him as Christ's bondman. Would he come under Peter's influence? It would be easy, staying with a brother fifteen days, to come under his influence. He might be well-to-do, or, as in Peter's case, he might be poor, for Peter was poor materially: "Silver and gold I have not". But Paul would not come under Peter's influence in this sense in which I am speaking of it. When it comes to the truth, what about that fifteen days with Peter? Would Paul say, Oh well, Peter entertained me, he did the best he could for me, I had better watch what I say, I had better modify what I say? Never Paul! "If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's
{385}
bondman". The Spirit of bondmanship would preserve us from getting under the influence of men. It would preserve ministers and servants from tempering and modifying their ministry because of the influence of men. If there is any influence that we have got to bring in in our service, it is the influence of heaven, the influence of Christ. As Paul says, "If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman". His whole outlook was to serve Christ faithfully, in the spirit of the bondman, fully committed without a reserve. Oh the reserves that we have, dear brethren! I speak feelingly, the word of God presses one in ministering it, the reserves that we have. Think of Paul, think of the fearlessness that marked him in the midst of the personnel at Jerusalem, conspicuous as some seemed to be, conspicuous as others were. Did it daunt Paul? No! his roots were in heaven, his roots were in Christ, he was walking in Christ. He had received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, and he was walking in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and he would not suffer the features of any other man to appear. What liberty he had! Was he in bondage to man? Never! Peter was affected by the influence of James, but never Paul. I speak soberly, guardedly about Peter, that honoured servant, such a choice vessel as Peter was; yet, the truth was modified in his mind and his soul because of external influence. Oh, dear brethren, we want to beware of the influence of man as man. We want to be without respect of persons. If there is anything that is baneful in the assembly, it is respect of persons. Paul loved Peter, and as he served Peter, it was because he loved him, that he was so faithful to his face and those good personal relations would stand in good stead. They would stand the strain. What a bondman Paul was! How free of the world he was. Crucified unto the world, and the world unto him. Bearing in his body the
{386}
brands of the Lord Jesus. The scandal of the cross testified to in all his walk, in which we see the refusal of every feature of the man of sin and shame. His pride and his wilfulness and his folly all refused by Paul. But oh, the liberty of the servant. You can understand as they looked at him, and watched him, how impressed they would be with him as formed in the spirit of the Master. I believe, dear brethren, especially in regard to those of us who serve as Christ's bondmen, we must be free from human influence, as mere human influence. What I say does not mitigate or militate against the influence of the assembly, because the influence of heaven is there. Or the influence of the brethren in relation to us. I am speaking of mere human influence, mere natural influence, mere influence of personality on human lines. Paul says, "If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman". Paul had to suffer, and how he suffered, how scurrilously they spoke of him at Corinth. He had begotten them through the glad tidings, and yet they spoke most contemptibly about him. Did it bind his affections up? No! The spirit of bondmanship shines in brightest lustre over against the darkest background in Corinth. Although the less loved, he was prepared to more abundantly love, and to spend and be spent. Does that mark us, dear brethren? Is the spirit of bondmanship with us in this sense? As Christ's bondmen what governs us? Where do we go to serve? How do we serve? Are we under the influence of heaven, and free from the influence of men? We want to see to it, each one of us, for to our Master we stand or fall. Some might say, Oh well, they *seem* to be under the influence of men. But we want to look into matters, and especially does Christ's bondman want to see that he is free from all earthly and human influence in regard to his ministry.
Now I want to say a word from the next passage.
{387}
I come to the types, which the servant always has a certain amount of latitude in doing, and I have read a well-known passage in Exodus. I suppose few passages are more gone over than this passage in Exodus. Often has one used it before, and one makes no apology for using it again tonight. But I want to refer to something in it that perhaps we do not speak too much about. It is not now standing at the doorway of conflict for the truth, and it is important as we have said, that in that setting we should be free from all human influence and respect of persons; otherwise we shall be biased and prejudiced, and lose our way in a conflict. But when we come to @Exodus 21, it stands at the door-way of the working out of difficult problems in our practical lives. In the chapters that immediately follow you get ox-goring, you get men stealing, you get misplaced affections as we have been referring to them in Samuel. But at the very portal, or in the very doorway of the section, there appears this spirit of the bondman. "I love my master, my wife, and my children, I will not go free". You may have a lot of things in your locality that are depicted in these three chapters, 21, 22 and 23, you may find a lot in them that is extremely testing. When things get out of control, when things are difficult to handle, where stealing comes in in regard to persons, in order to gain an unfair advantage, and where stealing comes in in regard to property (and I am speaking of it morally and spiritually), you may perhaps be discouraged, you may perhaps be disconsolate, but the Lord would have you tonight to take full account of the spirit of the bondman. How are these conditions to be met? Are they to be met by running away from them? Are they to be met by staying home from the care meeting, so that you will not have anything to say that night and will not therefore come into reproach on account of it? Never! The
{388}
bondman in @Exodus 21 would never be away from a care meeting. And what I want to point out is that he is brought before the judges. Now we often think of the Hebrew bondman in relation to the assembly meeting, and the Lord's supper, and the love of Christ as suggested in it, but I want, dear brethren, to dwell a little on the matter of the judges, and the bondman coming before the judges. The judges are mentioned through these next two chapters. They have to do with the adjudication of matters; they have to do with equity, and the dispensing of justice in matters, whether it be restitution or compensation -- persons and things come up before the judges. But what they are faced with first and what we all need to be faced with, is the spirit of the Hebrew bondman, "I love my master, my wife, and my children". He is above all personal considerations, he is above all selfish motives, and as his master brings him before the judges, the master would tell the judges, no doubt, what had happened. This man will not go free, he says, "I love my master, my wife and my children". What a reaction that would have on the judges! What a spirit, they would say, to be seen in a man, that puts his master, his wife and his children above every other consideration, his own liberty, his own independence. What a thing it is to see brothers and sisters that put God and His will, the assembly and the brethren, above every natural and selfish consideration! Think of that man before the judges! "His master shall bring him", as it says, "*before* the judges" -- not *to* the judges, but "*before* the judges". They would have a good look at him and they would say, Well, we have never seen a man like that before! And, dear brethren, we want to be like this man, this Hebrew bondman, as seen supremely in Christ. It is to affect the administrative position, the position of judgeship, the position where adjudication is
{389}
necessary in regard to matters. This spirit is to enter into it, that there should be no impure opaque motives with us, no selfish ulterior motives with us, that we should be completely free from all self-consideration or self-centredness. We are thinking only of the Master, we are thinking of God and of Christ, we are thinking of the assembly and the brethren, it comes into the assembly above all other things. So that if a matter comes up where an ox has been doing some goring -- well, maybe you have had something against a brother or sister, and if you are not careful it will enter into the care meeting and bias your judgment. You are quite ready to pass judgment, because you have got something against him. Not the Hebrew bondman! The saints are in his eyes as the wife and the children, the assembly you see, is in the ascendency in his view. If they fall beneath the level of the wife and the children, into the lower practices linked with goring and stealing, and setting on fire things, he still holds them in the light of the wife and the children, and he would serve them in that way. In principle, dear brethren, the spirit of the Hebrew bondman merges in the judges and colours the administration, and that is what is needed in our localities.
Now I just refer to the spirit of the bondman in Judah, standing as it does, at the portal and the doorway of the release of family feelings and family affections. Judah says "And now, let thy servant stay, I pray thee, instead of the lad a bondman to my lord". Someone has come to it, there were ten of them, they had all kinds of arguments and reasonings, all kinds of excuses, all kinds of defence put up. Ten men, sons of one father, all true men, and each, of them was wrong. But now someone comes to it. What was lacking was the great idea of bondmanship. They were selfish, they thought of themselves. You remember how they sold their brother for a
{390}
bondman, in chapter 37; Judah was involved in that matter -- one so near, as we might say, to Christ, as we project Judah and what he sets out typically, in the extended way, on to the view. J.N.D. says of Judah in the prophets, "guilty, but beloved, Judah", delivering Christ. As Samson was delivered by Judah to the Philistines (@Judges 15: 9 - 13) so Christ was delivered by the Jews. Think of Judah having part in the delivering up of Joseph! Reuben and the others were also in the crime. And as the following chapter opens up, how serious is the darkness that settled on Judah's soul, as the consequence of having part in that awful crime of selling Joseph for a bondman. @Genesis 38 opens and down, down, down Judah goes. He links on with Hirah the Adullamite who is called his friend in verse 12, and the shameful results of degeneration in the things that are said to be evil in God's sight, through not having been faithful to the truth and the light presented in chapter 37. But out of it all, God sovereignly brings Pherez, like He brought Solomon, that which means the continuance of the testimony. But here in chapter 44 Judah has got the gain of the reducing character of the government of God, in the death of his two children and all the sorrow linked with it. He dissociates himself, we might say now, from the man of sin and shame, just like Levi has to dissociate himself from the man of sin and shame. He says, "let thy servant stay, I pray thee, a bondman to my lord". He is prepared to take on full responsibility, to preserve the family side, and to make way for the Lord typically, in Joseph, to come in and release his affections among the brethren. What a need there is for the spirit of the bondman seen in Judah amongst us, dear brethren. May the Lord bless the word.
